Architecture and Design Overview
================================

This application breaks the overall problem of literate programming into the following sub-problems:

1.	Representation of the WEB document as Chunks and Commands

2.	Reading and parsing the input WEB document.

3.	Weaving a document file.

4. 	Tangling the desired program source files.

Here's the overall Context Diagram for this application:

..  uml:: 

    left to right direction
    skinparam actorStyle awesome
    
    actor "Developer" as Dev
    rectangle PyWeb {
        usecase "Tangle Source" as UC_Tangle
        usecase "Weave Document" as UC_Weave
    }
    rectangle IDE {
        usecase "Create WEB" as UC_Create
        usecase "Run Tests" as UC_Test
        usecase "Build Documentation" as UC_Doc
        usecase "Build Application" as UC_App
    }
    database WEB
    component App
    folder Documentation
    
    Dev --> UC_Create
    Dev --> UC_Test
    Dev --> UC_Doc
    Dev --> UC_App
    
    UC_Create --> WEB
    WEB --> UC_Tangle
    WEB --> UC_Weave
    
    UC_Tangle --> App
    UC_Weave --> Documentation
    
    UC_Test ..> UC_Tangle
    UC_Doc ..> UC_Weave
    UC_App ..> UC_Tangle

The idea here is a central WEB document contains both the application source code and the documentation that describes the code.
The documentation can present information in an order that's meaningful and helpful
to people.
The tangling operation orders information for the benefit of compilers and tools.

Since this is often part of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the container for all of these software components is the developer's desktop.
(We don't need a diagram for that.)

Here's a summary of the application-level components.
These are the most visible libraries and command-line applications:

..  uml::

    component pyweb
    package jinja
    pyweb ..> jinja
    
    package templates
    pyweb *-- templates
    jinja ..> templates
    
    component weave
    weave ..> pyweb
    
    component tangle
    tangle ..> pyweb


The ``weave`` and ``tangle`` are convenient scripts that import and customize the underlying ``pyweb`` application.
We've used the dotted "depends-on" arrow to depict this.
The ``pyweb`` application depends on Jinja2 to define the various templates for weaving the output documents.
The ``pyweb`` application contains the templates; this is shown with a solid line.

We can modify the templates to alter the look and feel.
The  supplied ``weave.py`` script shows how to do this.

In many cases, the final production will multiple steps,  as shown below:

..  uml::

     database WEB
     component pyweb
     artifact ".rst File" as RST
     component sphinx
     artifact ".html File" as HTML
     
     WEB --> pyweb
     pyweb --> RST
     RST --> sphinx
     sphinx --> HTML

We can use **pyweb-lp** to create an ``.rst`` file with the documentation.
This is then processed by Sphinx to inject a Sphinx theme and necessary CSS to make
responsive web document(s). 

This is often automated with a ``Makefile``.

Overall Structure
-----------------

Generally, the code breaks into three functional areas

-   The core representation of a WEB.

-   A parser to read the source WEB.

-   The emitters to produce woven and tangled output. This includes both weavers and tanglers.

We could depict it as follows:

    
..  uml:: 
    
    folder core {
        class Web
        class Chunk
        abstract class Command
        Web *-- "1..*" Chunk
        Chunk *-- "1..*" Command
    }
    folder parser {
        class WebReader
        WebReader --> Web
    }
    folder emitters {
        abstract class Emitter
        class Tangler
        class Weaver
        Emitter <|-- Tangler
        Emitter <|-- Weaver
        Emitter --> Web
    }


We'll look at the core model, first.

Core WEB Representation
-----------------------



The basic structure has three layers, as shown in the following diagram:
    
..  uml:: 
    
    class Web << dataclass >> {
        chunks: list[Chunk]
    }
    class Chunk {
        name: str
        commands: list[Command]
    }
    abstract class Command
    
    Web *-- "1..*" Chunk
    Chunk *-- "1..*" Command
    
    class CodeChunk
    Chunk <|-- CodeChunk
    
    class NamedChunk 
    Chunk <|-- NamedChunk
    
    class OutputChunk
    Chunk <|-- OutputChunk
    
    class NamedCodeChunk 
    Chunk <|-- NamedCodeChunk
    
    class TextCommand
    Command <|-- TextCommand
    
    class CodeCommand
    Command <|-- CodeCommand
    
    class ReferenceCommand
    Command <|-- ReferenceCommand
    
    class XRefCommand
    Command <|-- XRefCommand
    
    class FileXRefCommand
    XRefCommand <|-- FileXRefCommand
    
    class MacroXRefCommand
    XRefCommand <|-- MacroXRefCommand
    
    class UseridXRefCommand
    XRefCommand <|-- UseridXRefCommand
     
The source document is transformed into a ``Web``,  which is the overall container.
The source is decomposed into a sequence of ``Chunk`` instances.
Each ``Chunk`` is a sequence of ``Commands``.

``Chunk`` objects and ``Command`` objects cannot be nested, leading to delightful simplification.

The overall ``Web`` includes both the original sequence of ``Chunk`` objects as well as an index for the named ``Chunk`` instances.

Note that a named chunk may be created through a number of ``@@d`` commands.
This means that each named ``Chunk`` may be a sequence of definitions sharing a common name.
They are concatenated in order to permit decomposing a single concept into sequentially described pieces.
 
The various layers of ``Web``, ``Chunk``, and ``Command`` each have attributes designed to be usable by a Jinja template when weaving output.
When tangling, however, the only attribute that matters is the text contained in the ``@@{`` and ``@@}`` brackets.
This makes tangling somewhat simpler than weaving. 

There is a small interaction between a ``Tangler`` and each ``Chunk`` to work out the indentation. based in the context in which a ``@@< name @@>`` reference occurs.

Reading and Parsing
--------------------

..  uml::

    class Web
    class WebReader {
        parse(source) : Web
    }
    WebReader ..> Web
    class Tokenizer 
    WebReader ..> Tokenizer
    
    class OptionParser
    
    class OptionDef
    
    OptionParser *-- OptionDef
    
    WebReader ..> OptionParser

A solution to the reading and parsing problem depends on a convenient  tool for breaking up the input stream and a representation for the chunks of input  and the sequence of commands.
Input decomposition is done with something we might call the **Splitter** design pattern. 

The **Splitter** pattern is widely used in text processing, and has a long legacy
in a variety of languages and libraries.
A **Splitter** decomposes a string into a sequence of strings using some split pattern.
There are many variant implementations.
For example, one variant locates only a single occurence (usually the left-most); this is
commonly implemented as a Find or Search string function.
Another variant locates all occurrences of a specific string or character, and discards the matching string or character.

The variation on **Splitter** in this application creates each element in the resulting sequence as either
(1) an instance of the  split regular expression or
(2) the text between split patterns.

We define our splitting pattern with the regular
expression ``'@@.|\n'``.  This will split on either of these patterns:

-	 ``@@`` followed by a single character,

-	or, a newline.

For the most part, ``\n`` is only text, and as almost no special significance.
The exception is the ``@@i`` *filename* command, which ends at the end of the line, making the ``\n`` significant syntax in this case.

We could be more specific with the following as a split pattern: ``'@@[doOifmu\|<>(){}\[\]]|\n'``.
This would silently ignore unknown commands,  merging them in with the surrounding text.
This would leave the ``'@@@@'`` sequences  completely alone, allowing us to replace ``'@@@@'`` with ``'@@'`` in every text chunk.
It's not clear this additional level of detail is helpful.

Within the ``@@d`` and ``@@o`` commands, there is a name and options.
These follow the syntax rules for Tcl or the shell.
Optional fields are prefaced with ``-``.
All options must come before all positional arguments.
The positional arguments provide the name being defined.
In effect, the name is ``' '.join(args.split(' ')``;
this means multiple adjacent spaces in a name will be collapsed to a single space.

Emitters
--------

There are two possible outputs from this application:

-   A woven document.

-   One or more tangled source files.

The overall structure of the classes is shown in the following diagram.

..  uml::
    
    class Web
    
    abstract class Emitter {
        emit(web)
    }
    
    Emitter ..> Web
    
    class Weaver
    Emitter <|-- Weaver
    
    class Tangler
    Emitter <|-- Tangler
    
    class TanglerMake
    Tangler <|-- TanglerMake
    
    abstract class ReferenceStyle
    Weaver --> ReferenceStyle
    
    class Simple
    ReferenceStyle <|-- Simple
    
    class Transitive
    ReferenceStyle <|-- Transitive
    
    class Template
    Weaver --> Template
    
    class "Jinja Macro" as macro
    Template *-- macro

We'll look at the weaving activity first, then the tangling activity.

Weaving
---------

The weaving activity depends on having a target document markup language.
There are several approaches to this problem.  

-   We can use a markup language unique to **py-web-lp**.
    This would hide the final target markup language. It would mean
    that **py-web-lp** would be equivalent to a tool like **Pandoc**,
    producing a variety of target markup languages from a single, common source.
	
-   We can use any of the existing markup languages (HTML, RST, Markdown, LaTeX, etc.) 
    expand snippets of markup into author-supplied markup to create the 
    target woven document.

The problem with the first method is defining yet-another-markup-language.
This seems needlessly complex.

The problem with the second method is the source WEB file is a mixture of the following two things:

-   The background document in some standard markup and 

-   The code elements, which need to be wrapped in some markup.

In languages like RST and Markdown, there's a small textual wrapper around code samples.
In languages like HTML, the wrapper can be much more complex.
Also, certain code characters may need to be properly escaped if the code sample happens to contain markup that should **not** be processed, but treated as literal text.
In LaTeX, the wrapper can be quite complex.

The author should not be foreced to repeat the wrappers around each code examples. 
This should be delegated to the literate programming tool.
Further, the author should not be narrowly constrained by the markup injected
by the weaving process; the weaver should be extensible to add features. 

Currently, this leads to using the **Facade** design pattern.
The weaver is a **Facade** over the Jinja template engine.
The tool provides default templates in RST, HTML, and LaTeX.
These can be replaced; new templates can be added.
The templates used to wrap code sections can be tweaked relatively easily.

This is -- in the long run -- unsustainable.
It means some elements of the document are **not** in the ``.w`` WEB file.
See the :ref:`todo` section for more on these new commands.

Tangling
----------

The tangling activity produces output files.
In other Literate Programming tools, some care was taken to understand the source code context for tangling, and
provide a correct indentation.
This required a command-line parameter to turn off indentation for languages like Fortran, where identation is not used.

In **py-web-lp**, there are two options:

-   The default behavior is that the indent of a ``@@< name @@>`` command is used to set the indent of the  material is expanded in place of this reference.
    If all ``@@<`` commands are presented at the left margin, no indentation will be done.
    This is helpful simplification, particularly for users of Python, where indentation is significant.

-   A flag on a ``@@d`` chunk  can override the indentation rule to force the material to be placed at the left margin in spite of the `@@<`` command being indented.

Generally, tangling collects the ``@@o`` chunks and referenced ``@@d`` chunks into files.
The ``@@<`` references are expanded.
Other than indentation control, no additional transformation is performed.

Application
------------

The overall application has the following layers to it:
    
-   An ``Action`` class hierarchy that includes the actions of Load, Tangle, and Weave.

-   An overall ``Application`` class that executes the actions.

-   A top-level main function parses the command line, creates and configures the actions, and executes the sequence
    of actions.
    
The idea is that the Weaver Action should be visible to tools like `PyInvoke <https://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/stable/index.html>`_.
We want ``Weave("someFile.w")`` to be a sensible task.  

..  uml::

    abstract class Action
    
    class ActionSequence
    Action <|-- ActionSequence
    ActionSequence *-- "2..m" Action
    
    class LoadAction
    Action <|-- LoadAction
    
    class WeaveAction
    Action <|-- WeaveAction
    
    class TangleAction
    Action <|-- TangleAction
    
    class Application
    
    Application *-- Action

This shows the essential structure of the top-level classes.
