Introduction
============

..	test/test_intro.w

There are two levels of testing in this document.

-	`Unit Testing`_

-	`Functional Testing`_

Other testing, like performance or security, is possible.
But for this application, not very interesting.

The ``pyweb_test.w`` WEB creates the test suite.
This source will weave a ``pyweb_test.rst`` file.
It tangles several test modules:  ``test.py``, ``test_tangler.py``, ``test_weaver.py``,
``test_loader.py``, ``test_unit.py``, and ``test_scripts.py``.

Use **pytest** to discover and run all 80+ test cases.

Here's a script that works out well for running this without disturbing the development
environment. The ``PYTHONPATH`` setting is essential to support importing ``pyweb``.

..	parsed-literal::

	python pyweb.py -o tests tests/pyweb_test.w
	PYTHONPATH=$(PWD) pytest

Note that the last line sets an environment variable and runs
the ``pytest`` tool on a single line.
