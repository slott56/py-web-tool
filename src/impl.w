Implementation
==============

The implementation is contained in a single Python module defining 
the all of the classes and functions, as well as an overall ``main()`` function.  The ``main()``
function uses these base classes to weave and tangle the output files.

The broad outline of the presentation is as follows:

-   `Base Classes`_ that define a model for the ``.w`` file.

    -   `Web Class`_ contains the overall Web of Chunks. A Web is a sequence
        of `Chunk` objects. It's also a mapping from chunk name to definition.
    
    -   `Chunk Class Hierarchy`_ are pieces of the source document, built into a Web.
        A ``Chunk`` is a collection of ``Command`` instances.  This can be
        either an anonymous chunk that will be sent directly to the output, 
        or a named chunks delimited by the structural ``@@d`` or ``@@o`` commands.
    
    -   `Command Class Hierarchy`_ are the items within a ``Chunk``. The text and
        the inline ``@@<name@@>`` references are the principle command classes.  
        Additionally, there are some cross reference commands (``@@f``, ``@@m``, or ``@@u``).

-   `Output Serialization`_. This is the ``Emitter`` class
    hierarchy writes various kinds of files. 
    These decompose into two subclasses:
            
         -  A ``Tangler`` creates source code. 
         
         -  A ``Weaver`` creates documentation. The various Jinja-based templates
            are part of weaving.
         
-   `Input Parsing`_ covers deserialization from the source ``.w`` file
    to the base model of ``Web``, ``Chunk``, and ``Command``.
    
    -   `The WebReader class`_ which parses the Web structure.
    
    -   `The Tokenizer class`_ which tokenizes the raw input.
        
-   Other application components:
        
    -   `Error Class`_ defines an application-specific exception.
        This covers all of the various kinds of problems that might arise.

    -   `Action class hierarchy`_ defines things this program does.
    
    -   `The Application class`_. This is an overall class definition that includes
        command line parsing, picking an Action, configuring and executing the Action.
        It could be a set of related functions, but we've bound them into a class.
    
    -   `Logging setup`_. This includes a simple context manager for logging.
    
    -   `The Main Function`_.
    
    -   `pyWeb Module File`_ defines the final module file that contains the application.

We'll start with the base classes that define the 
data model for the source WEB of chunks.

Base Classes
-------------

Here are some of the base classes that define
the structure and meaning of a ``.w`` source file.

@d Base Class Definitions 
@{
@<Command class hierarchy -- used to describe individual commands in a chunk@>

@<Chunk class hierarchy -- used to describe individual chunks@>

@<Web class -- describes the overall "web" of chunks@>
@}

The above order is reasonably helpful for Python and minimizes forward
references. The ``Chunk``, ``Command``, and ``Web`` instances do have a circular relationship,
making a strict ordering a bit complex.

We'll start at the central collection of information, the ``Web`` class of objects.

Web Class
~~~~~~~~~

The overall web of chunks is contained in a 
single instance of the ``Web`` class that is the principle parameter for the weaving and tangling actions.  
Broadly, the functionality of a Web can be separated into the folloowing areas:

- It is constructed by a ``WebReader``.

- It also supports "enrichment" of the web, once all the ``Chunk`` instances are known. 
  This is a stateful update to the web.  Each ``Chunk`` is updated with 
  references it makes as well as references to it.

- It supports ``Chunk`` cross-reference methods that traverse this enriched data.
  This includes a kind of validity check to be sure that everything is used once
  and once only. 
  

Fundamentally, a ``Web`` is a hybrid list+mapping. It as the following features:

-   It's a ``Sequence`` to retain all ``Chunk`` instances in order.

-   It's a mapping of name-to-Chunk that also offers a 
    moderately sophisticated
    lookup, including exact match for a ``Chunk`` name and an approximate match for a
    an abbreviated name. 

The ``Web`` is built by the parser by loading the sequence of ``Chunk`` instances.

Note that the WEB source language has a "mixed content model". This means the code chunks
have specific tags with names. The text, on the other hand, is interspersed
among the code chunks. The text belongs to implicit, unnamed text chunks.

A web instance has a number of attributes.

:chunks:
    the sequence of ``Chunk`` instances as seen in the input file.
    To support anonymous chunks, and to assure that the original input document order
    is preserved, we keep all chunks in a master sequential list.

:files:
    the ``@@o`` named ``OutputChunk`` chunks.  
    Each element of this  dictionary is a sequence of chunks that have the same name. 
    The first is the initial definition (marked with "="), all others a second definitions
    (marked with "+=").

:macros:
    the ``@@d`` named ``NamedChunk`` chunks.  Each element of this 
    dictionary is a sequence of chunks that have the same name.  The first is the
    initial definition (marked with "="), all others a second definitions
    (marked with "+=").

:userids:
    the cross reference of chunks referenced by commands in other
    chunks.

This relies on the way a ``@@dataclass`` does post-init processing.
One the raw sequence of ``Chunks`` has been presented, some additional
processing is done to link each ``Chunk`` to the web. This permits
the ``full_name`` property to expand abbreviated names to full names,
and, consequently, chunk references.

@}

The class defines one visible element of a ``Web`` instance,
the ``chunks`` list of ``Chunk`` instances. From this list of
``Chunk`` objects, the remaining internal objects are built.
These include the following:
 
-  ``chunk_map`` has the mapping of chunk names to list of chunks that provide the definition for the chunk.

-   ``userid_map`` has the mapping of user-defined names to the list of chunks that define the name.

-   ``references`` is the set of all referenced chunks.

Additionally there are attributes to contain a logger, a reference to the WEB file path,
used to evaluate expressions, and a "strict-match" option that can report errors during
name resolution. Disabling this will allow documents to be tangled that are potentially
incomplete. 

Generally, a parser will create a list of ``Chunk`` objects. From this, the
parser can creates the final ``Web``.

@}

The  ``__post_init__()`` special method populates the detailed structure of the WEB document. 
There are several passes through the WEB to digest the data:

1.  Set all ``Chunk`` and ``Command`` back references to the ``Web`` container.
    This is required so a ``Chunk`` with a ``ReferenceCommand`` instance can properly
    refer to a chunk elsewhere in the ``Web`` container. There are all weak
    references to faciliate garbgage collection.

2.  Locate the unabbreviated names in chunks and references to chunks.
    Names can found in two places. The ``@@d`` command provides a name.
    A ``@@<name@@>`` command can also provide a reference to a name. 
    The unabbreviated names define the structure. Unambiguous abbreviations can be
    used freely, since full names are located first.

3.  Accumulate chunk lists, output lists, and name definition lists. This pass
    does two things. First any user-defined name after a ``@@|`` command
    is accumulated. Second, any abbreviated name is resolved to the full name, 
    and the complete mapping from chunk name to a sequence of defining chunks is completed.

4.  Set the ``referencedBy`` attribute of a ``Chunk`` instance with all of the
    commands that point to it. The idea here is that a top-level ``Chunk`` instance
    may have references to other ``Chunk`` isntances. This forms a kind of tree.
    Any given low-level ``Chunk`` object is named by a sequence of parent ``Chunk`` objects.

Once the initialization is complete, the ``Web`` instance can be woven or tangled.

The representation of a ``Web`` instance is a sequence of ``Chunk`` instances.
This can be long and difficult to read. It is, however, complete, and can be 
used to build instances of ``Web`` objects from a variety of sources.

Name and Chunk resolution are similar.
Name resolution provides only the expanded name. 
Chunk resolution provides the list of chunks that define a name.
Chunk resolution expands on the basic features of Name resolution.

The complex ``target.endswith('...')`` processing only happens once
during ``__post_init__()`` processing. After the initalization is complete, 
all ``ReferenceCommand`` objects will have a ``full_name`` attribute
that avoids the complication of resolving a name with a ``...`` ellipsis.

The point of the ``Web`` object is to be able to manage a variety of 
structures. These iterator methods and properties provide the list of
``@@o`` chunks, ``@@d`` chunks, and the usernames after ``@@|`` in a chunk.

Additionally, we can confirm the overall structure by asserting
that each ``@@d`` name has one reference. A name with no references
indicates an omission, a name with multiple references suggests a spelling
or ellipsis problem.

A ``Web`` instance is built by a ``WebReader``. 
It's used by an ``Emitter``, including a ``Weaver`` as well as a ``Tangler``.
A ``Web`` is composed of individual ``Chunk`` instances.

Chunk Class Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``Chunk`` is a piece of the input file.  It is a collection of ``Command`` instances.
A ``Chunk`` can be woven or tangled to create output.

..  uml::

    class Chunk {
        name: str
        seq: int
        commands: list[Command]
        options: list[str]
        def_names: list[str]
        initial: bool
    }
    
    class OutputChunk
    Chunk <|-- OutputChunk
    
    class NamedChunk
    Chunk <|-- NamedChunk
    
These subclasss reflect three kinds of content in the WEB source document:

-  ``Chunk`` is the anonymous text context. 
        Text in the body generally becomes a ``TextCommand``.
        Also, the various XREF commands (``@@m``, ``@@f``, ``@@u``) can *only* appear here.
        In principle, a ``@@< reference @@>`` can appear in text. 
        It must name a ``@@d name @@[...@@]`` NamedDocumentChunk, which is expanded in place, not linked.

-  ``OutputChunk`` is the ``@@o`` context. 
        Text in the body becomes a ``CodeCommand``.
        Any ``@@< reference @@>`` will be expanded when tangling, but become a link when weaving.
        This defines an output file.

-  ``NamedChunk`` is the ``@@d`` context. 
        Text in the body becomes a ``CodeCommand``.
        Any ``@@< reference @@>`` will be expanded when tangling, but become a link when weaving.

Most of the attributes are pushed up to the superclass. This makes type checking the complex
WEB tree much simpler.

The attributes are visible to the Jinja templates. In particular the sequence number, ``seq``, 
and the initial definition indicator, ``initial``, are often used to customize presentation of the
woven content.

A ``type_is()`` method is used to discern the various subtypes. This slightly simplifies
the work done by a template. It's not easy to rely on proper inheritance because the templates
are implemented in a separate language with their own processing rules.

Command Class Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``Chunk`` is a sequence of ``Command`` instances. For the generic ``Chunk`` superclass,
the commands are -- mostly -- the ``TextCommand`` subclass of ``Command``.
These are blocks of text. A ``Chunk`` may also include some ``XRefCommand`` instances
which expand to cross-reference material for an index.

For the ``CodeChunk`` and ``NamedChunk`` subclasses, the commands are
``CodeCommand`` instances intermixed with ``ReferenceCommand`` instances.
A ``CodeCommand`` has a wrapper when weaving. Additionally, it will tangled
into the output. A ``ReferenceCommand`` becomes a link when weaving, and expands
to it's full body when being tangled. 

..  uml::

    class Chunk {
        name: str
        commands: list[Command]
    }
    abstract class Command {
        {static} has_name: bool
        {static} has_text: bool
        {static} typeid: TypeId
        text: str
        tangle(Tangler, Target)
    }

    class TypeId {
        __getattr__(str) : bool
    }

    Command -- TypeId

Each of these variants has the possibility of distinct processing
when weaving the final document. The type information must be 
visibile to the Jinja template processing. This is done
through an instance of the ``TypeId`` class attached
to each of these classes.

The input stream is broken into individual commands, based on the
various ``@@``\ *x* strings in the file.  There are several subclasses of ``Command``,
each used to describe a different command or block of text in the input.

All instances of the ``Command`` class are created by the ``WebReader`` instance.  
In this case, a ``WebReader`` can be thought of as a factory for ``Command`` instances.
Each ``Command`` instance is appended to the sequence of commands that
belong to a ``Chunk``.

This model permits two kinds of serialization:

-   Weaving a document from the WEB source file. This uses the various attributes
    of the various subclasses.

-   Tangling target documents with code. This relies on a ``tangle()`` method 
    in each subclass.

We'll address the run-time type identification first,
the the definitions of the various ``Command`` subclasses.

The TypeId Class
****************

The ``TypeId`` class provides run-time type
identification to the Jinja templates. The idea is ``object.typeid.AClass`` is 
equivalent to ``isinstance(object, pyweb.AClass)``. It has simpler syntax
and works better with Jinja templates. It helps sort out the various nodes of the AST
built from the source WEB document. 

There are three parts to the ``TypeId`` implementation:

-   A ``TypeId`` class definition to handle the attribute access.
    A reference to ``object.typeid.Name`` evaluates ``__getattr__(object, 'Name')``.
    
-   A metaclass definition, ``TypeIdMeta``, to inject the new ``typeid`` attribute into each class.

-   The normal class initialization process, which evaluates ``__set_name__()``
    for each attribute of a class that defines the method. This provides the
    containing class to the ``TypeId`` instance. 

The idea of run-time type identification is -- in a way -- a failure to properly
define the classes to follow the Liskov Substitution design principle. A better
design would check for specific features of a subclass of ``Command``.
This becomes awkwardly complex in the Jinja templates, because the templates exist
outside the class hierarchy. We rely on the ``typeid`` to map classes to macros appropriate to the class.

The ``TypeIdMeta`` metaclass sets the ``typeid`` attribute of each class defined by this metaclass. 
The ordinary class preparation will invoke
the ``__set_name__()`` special method to provide details to the attribute.

Once set, any reference to ``c.typeid.name`` will be evaluated as ``__getattr__(c, 'name')``.
This permits the typeid to compare the name provided by ``__set_name__()`` with the name
being inquired about.

An ``Emitter`` instance is responsible for control of an output file format.

The Weaver Subclass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Weaver is a **Facade** that wraps Jinja template processing.

The job is to build the necessary environment, locate the templates, 
and then evaluate the template's ``generate()`` method to fill the values
into the template to create the woven document.

There's "base_weaver" template that contains the essential structure of
the output document. This creates the needed macros, and then weaves the various chunks, in order.

Each unique markup language has macros that provide the unique markup required for
the various chunks. This permits customization of the markup.  

We have an interesting wrinkle with RST-formatted output. There are two variants that may be important:

- When used with Sphinx, the "small" caption at the end of a code block uses ``..  rst-class:: small``.

- When used without Sphinx, i.e., native docutils, the the "small" caption at the end of a code block uses ``..  class:: small``.

This is a minor change to the template being used. The question is how to make that distinction
in the weaver? One view is to use subclasses of :py:class:`Weaver` for this.
However, the templates are found by name in the ``template_map`` within the ``Weaver``.
The ``--weaver`` command-line option provides the string (e.g., ``rst`` or ``html``) used
to build a key into the template map. 

We can, therefore, use the ``--weaver`` command-line option  to provide an expanded set of names for RST processing.

- ``-w rst`` is the Sphinx option.

- ``-w rst-sphinx`` is an alias for ``rst``. The dictionary key points to the same templates as ``rst``.

- ``-w rst-nosphinx`` is the "pure-docutils" version, using ``.. class::``. 

- ``-w rst-docutils`` is an alias for the nosphinx option.

While this works out nicely, it turns out that the ``..  container:: small`` is, perhaps, a better
markup that ``..  class:: small``. This work in docutils **and** Sphinx.

There are several strategy plug-ins. Each is unique for a particular flavort of markup.
These include the quoting function used to escape markup characters,
and the templates used.

The objective is to have a generic "weaver" template which includes three levels
of template definition:

1. Defaults.
2. Configured overrides, perhaps from ``pyweb.toml``.
3. Document overrides from the ``.w`` file in ``@@t name @@{...@@}`` commands.

This means there is a two-step binding between document and macros.

1. The base weaver document should import three generic template definitions:

    ``{%- from 'markup' import * %}``

    ``{%- from 'configured' import * %}``

    ``{%- from 'document' import * %}``

2. These names map (*somehow*) to specific templates based on markup language.
    ``markup`` -> ``rst/markup``, etc.
    
This allows us to provide all templates and make a final binding
at weave time. We can use a prefix loader with a given prefix.
Some kind of "import rst/markup as markup" would be ideal. 

Jinja, however, doesn't seem to support this the same way Python does.
There's no ``import as`` construct allowing very late binding.
 
The alternative is to 
create the environment very late in the process, once we have all the information
available. We can then pick the templates to put into a DictLoader to support
the standard weaving structure.

The quoting rules apply to the various
template languages. The idea is that
a few characters must be escaped for
proper presentation in the code sample sections.

Common Base Template
********************

The common base template expands each chunk and each command in order.
This involves some special case processing for ``OutputChunk`` and ``NamedChunk``
which have a "wrapper" woven around the chunk's sequence of commands.

This relies on a number of individual macros:

-   text(command). Emits a block of text -- this should do *nothing* with the text. The author's original
    markup passes through untouched.
    
-   begin_code(chunk). Starts a block of code, either ``@@d`` or ``@@o``.
 
-   code(command). Emits a block fo code. This may require escapes for special characters that would break
    the markup being used.
    
-   ref(command). Emits a reference to a named block of code. 

-   end_code(chunk). Ends a block of code.

-   file_xref(command). Emit the full ``@@f`` output, usually some kind of definition list.

-   macro_xref(command). Emit the full ``@@m`` output, usually some kind of definition list.

-   userid_xref(command). Emit the full ``@@u`` output, usually some kind of definition list.

The ``ref()`` macro can also be used in the XREF output macros. It can also be used in the ``end_code()`` macro.
After a block of code, some tools (like Interscript) will show where the block was referenced.
The point of using the ``ref()`` macro in multiple places is to make all of them look identical.

There are a variety of optional formatting considerations. First is cross-references,
second is a variety of ``begin_code()`` options.


There are four styles for the "referencedBy" information in a ``Chunk``.

-   Nothing. 

-   The immediate ``@@<name@@>`` Chunk.

-   The entire transitive sequence of parents for the ``@@<name@@>`` Chunk. There
    are two forms for this:
    
    -   Top-down path. ``→ Named (1) / → Sub-Named (2) / → Sub-Sub-Named (3)``.
    
    -   Bottom-up path.  ``→ Sub-Sub-Named (3) ∈ → Sub-Named (2) ∈ → Named (1)``.

These require four distinct versions of the ``end_code()`` macro. This macro uses the ``transitive_referencedBy``
propery of a ``Chunk`` producing a sequence of ``ref()`` values.

has multiple definitions.

The above should have the same output as the follow (more complex) alternative:

Currently, we casually treat the first instance
as the "definition", and don't provide references
to the additional parts of the definition.

The Tangler Subclasses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tangling is a variation on emitting that includes all the code in the order
defined by the ``@@o`` file commands. This is not necessarily the order
they're presented in the document.

The whole point of Weaving and Tangling is to write a document in an order that's
sensible for people to understand. The tangled output is for compilers
and run-time environments.

Each file is individually tangled, unrelated to the order of the source
WEB document. The ``emit()`` process, therefore, iterates through all
of the files defined in the WEB.

There's a complex interplay between ``Tangler`` and ``CodeCommand``
to maintain the indentations.

..  uml::

    participant Tangler
    
    participant ReferenceCommand
    
    participant Command
    
    Tangler --> ReferenceCommand : tangle()
    ReferenceCommand --> Tangler : get len(fragment)
    ReferenceCommand --> Tangler : addIndent(i)
    group [for all] commands in the referenced chunk
        ReferenceCommand --> Command : tangle()
    end 
    ReferenceCommand --> Tangler : clrIndent()

This approach can preserves the indentation in front of a ``@@< reference @@>`` command.

    @< Emitter write a block of code with proper indents @>

    @< Emitter indent control: set, clear and reset @>
@}

The ``codeBlock()`` method is used by each block of code tangled into 
a document. There are two sources of indentation:

-   A ``Chunk`` can provide an indent setting as an option. This is provided by the ``indent`` attribute
    of the tangle context. If specified, this is the indentation. 
    
-   A ``@@< name @@>`` ``ReferenceCommand`` may be indented. This will be in a ``Chunk`` as the following three commands:

    1.  A ``CodeCommand`` with only spaces and no trailing ``\n``. 
        The indent is buffered -- not written -- and the ``fragment`` attribute is set.
    
    2.  The ``ReferenceCommand``. This interpolates text from a ``NamedChunk`` using the prevailing indent.
        The ``tangle()`` method uses ``addIndent()`` and ``clrIndent()`` to mark this. The processing depends 
        on this tangler's ``fragment`` attribute to provide the pending indentation; the ``addIndent()`` 
        must consume the fragment to prevent confusion with subsequent indentations.
    
    3.  A ``CodeCommand`` with a trailing ``\n``. (Often it's only the newline.)  If the ``fragment`` attribute
        is set, there's a pending indentation that hasn't yet been written.
        This can happen with there's a ``@@@@`` command at the left end of a line; often a Python decorator. 
        The fragment is written and the ``fragment`` attribute cleared.  No ``addIdent()`` will have
        been done to consume the fragment. 
    
While the WEB language permits multiple ``@@<name@@> @@<name@@>`` on a single line,
this is odd and potentially confusing. It isn't clear how the second reference
should be indented.

The ``ReferenceCommand`` ``tangle()`` implementation handles much of this. 
The following two rules apply:
    
-   A line of text that does not end with a newline, sets a new prevailing indent
    for the following command(s).

-   A line of text ending with a newline resets the prevailing indent.

This a stack, maintained by the Tangler.

The ``addIndent()`` increments the indent. 
Used by ``@@<name@@>`` to set a prevailing indent.

The ``setIndent()`` pushes a fixed indent instead adding an increment. 
Used by a ``Chunk`` with an ``-indent`` option.
    
The ``clrIndent()`` method discards the most recent indent from the context stack.  
This is used when finished
tangling a source chunk.  This restores the indent to the prevailing indent.

The ``resetIndent()`` method removes all indent context information and resets the indent
to a default.

An extension to the ``Tangler`` class that only updates a file if the content has changed.
This tangles to a temporary file. If the content is identical, the temporary
file is quietly disposed of. Otherwise, the temporary file is linked to
the original name.  

Files are compared with the ``filecmp`` module.

Input Parsing

=   Additionally, a separate parser is used for options in ``@@d`` and ``@@o`` commands.

-   The overall ``WebReader`` class.

The WebReader Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two forms of the constructor for a ``WebReader``.  The 
initial ``WebReader`` instance is created with code like the following:


..  parsed-literal::

    p = WebReader()
    p.command = options.commandCharacter 

This will define the command character; usually provided as a command-line parameter to the application.

When processing an include file (with the ``@@i`` command), a child ``WebReader``
instance is created with code like the following:

..  parsed-literal::

    c = WebReader(parent=parentWebReader)


This will inherit the configuration from the parent ``WebReader``.  
This will also include a  reference from child to parent so that embedded Python expressions
can view the entire input context.

The ``WebReader`` class parses the input file into command blocks.
These are assembled into ``Chunks``, and the ``Chunks`` are assembled into the document
``Web``.  Once this input pass is complete, the resulting ``Web`` can be tangled or
woven.

The commands have three general types:

-   "Structural" commands define the structure of the ``Chunks``.  The  structural commands 
    are ``@@d`` and ``@@o``, as well as the ``@@{``, ``@@}``, ``@@[``, ``@@]`` brackets, 
    and the ``@@i`` command to include another file.

-   "Inline" commands are inline within a ``Chunk``: they define internal ``Commands``.  
    Blocks of text are minor commands, as well as the ``@@<``\ *name*\ ``@@>`` references.
    The ``@@@@`` escape is also
    handled here so that all further processing is independent of any parsing.

-   "Content" commands generate woven content. These include 
    the various cross-reference commands (``@@f``, ``@@m`` and ``@@u``).  

There are two class-level ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` instances used by this class.

:output_option_parser:
    An ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` used to parse the ``@@o`` command's options.
    
:definition_option_parser:
    An ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` used to parse the ``@@d`` command's options.

The class has the following attributes:

:parent:
    is the outer ``WebReader`` when processing a ``@@i`` command.

:command:
    is the command character; a WebReader will use the parent command 
    character if the parent is not ``None``. Default is ``@@``.

:permitList:
    is the list of commands that are permitted to fail.  This is generally 
    an empty list or ``('@@i',)``.

:_source:
    The open file-like object being used by ``load()``.
    
:filePath:
    The path being processed; this provides a visible file name.

:tokenizer:
    An instance of ``Tokenizer`` used to parse the input. This is built
    when ``load()`` is called.
    
:totalLines:
:totalFiles:
:errors:
    Summary counts.

The reader maintains a context into which constructs are added.
The ``Web`` contains ``Chunk`` instances in ``self.web.chunks``.
The current chunk is ``self.web.chunks[-1]``.
Each ``Chunk``, similarly, has a command context in ``chunk.commands[-1]``.

This works because the language is "flat": there are no nested ``@@d`` or ``@@o``
chunks.

Command recognition is done via a **Chain of Command**-like design.
There are two conditions: the command string is recognized or it is not recognized.
If the command is recognized, ``handleCommand()`` will do one of the following:

-   For "structural" commands, it will attach the current ``Chunk`` (*self.aChunk*) to the 
    current ``Web`` (*self.aWeb*), and start a new ``Chunk``. This becomes the context
    for processing commands. By default an anonymous ``Chunk`` used to accumulate text
    is available for all of the content outside named chunks.

-   For "inline" and "content" commands, create a ``Command``, attach it to the current 
    ``Chunk`` (*self.aChunk*).

If the command is not recognized, ``handleCommand()`` returns false, and this is a syntax error.

A subclass can override ``handleCommand()`` to 

(1) Evaluate this superclass version;

(2) If the command is unknown to the superclass, 
    then the subclass can process it;

(3) If the command is unknown to both classes, 
    then return ``False``.  Either a subclass will handle it, or the default activity taken
    by ``load()`` is to treat the command as a syntax error.

The ``handleCommand()`` implementation is a massive ``match`` statement.
It might be a good idea to decompose this into a number of separate methods.
This would make the ``match`` statement shorter and easier to understand.

An output chunk has the form ``@@o`` *name* ``@@{`` *content* ``@@}``.
We use the first two tokens to name the ``OutputChunk``.  We expect
the ``@@{`` separator.  We then attach all subsequent commands
to this chunk while waiting for the final ``@@}`` token to end the chunk.

We'll use an ``ArgumentParser`` to locate the optional parameters.  This will then let
us build an appropriate instance of ``OutputChunk``.

With some small additional changes, we could use ``OutputChunk(**options)``.

    comment_end=options.end if '-end' in options else "",
)
self.content.append(new_chunk)
# capture an OutputChunk up to @@}
@}

A named chunk has the form ``@@d`` *name* ``@@{`` *content* ``@@}`` for
code and ``@@d`` *name* ``@@[`` *content* ``@@]`` for document source.
We use the first two tokens to name the ``NamedChunk`` or ``NamedDocumentChunk``.  
We expect either the ``@@{`` or ``@@[`` separator, and use the actual
token found to choose which subclass of ``Chunk`` to create.
We then attach all subsequent commands
to this chunk while waiting for the final ``@@}`` or ``@@]`` token to 
end the chunk.

We'll use an ``ArgumentParser`` to locate the optional parameter of ``-noindent``.

**TODO:** Extend this to support ``-indent`` *number*

Then we can use the ``options`` value to create an appropriate subclass of ``NamedChunk``.
        
If ```"-indent"`` is in options, this is the default. 
If both are in the options, we should provide a warning.

**TODO:** Add a warning for conflicting options.

An import command has the unusual form of ``@@i`` *name*, with no trailing
separator.  When we encounter the ``@@i`` token, the next token will start with the
file name, but may continue with an anonymous chunk.  To avoid confusion,
we require that all ``@@i`` commands occur at the end of a line, 
The break on the ``'\n'`` which ends the file name.
This permits file names with embedded spaces. It also permits arguments and options,
if really necessary.

Once we have split the file name away from the rest of the following anonymous chunk,
we push the following token (a ``\n``) back into the token stream, so that it will be the 
first token examined at the top of the ``load()`` loop.

We create a child ``WebReader`` instance to process the included file.  The entire file 
is loaded into the current ``Web`` instance.  A new, empty ``Chunk`` is created at the end
of the file so that processing can resume with an anonymous ``Chunk``.

The reader has a ``permitList`` attribute.
This lists any commands where failure is permitted.  Currently, only the ``@@i`` command
can be set to permit failure; this allows a ``.w`` to include
a file that does not yet exist.  
 
The primary use case for this permitted error feature is when weaving test output.
A first use of the **py-web-lp** can be used to tangle the program source files,
ignoring a missing test output file, named in an ``@@i`` command.
The application can then be run to create the missing test output file. 
After this, a second use of the **py-web-lp**
can weave the test output file into a final, complete document.

When a ``@@}`` or ``@@]`` are found, this finishes a named chunk.  The next
text is therefore part of an anonymous chunk.

Note that no check is made to assure that the previous ``Chunk`` was indeed a named
chunk or output chunk started with ``@@{`` or ``@@[``.  
To do this, an attribute would be
needed for each ``Chunk`` subclass that indicated if a trailing bracket was necessary.
For the base ``Chunk`` class, this would be false, but for all other subclasses of
``Chunk``, this would be true.

# Start a new context for text or commands *after* this command.

User identifiers occur after a ``@@|`` command inside a ``NamedChunk``.

Note that no check is made to assure that the previous ``Chunk`` was indeed a named
chunk or output chunk started with ``@@{``.  
To do this, an attribute would be
needed for each ``Chunk`` subclass that indicated if user identifiers are permitted.
For the base ``Chunk`` class, this would be false, but for the ``NamedChunk`` class and
``OutputChunk`` class, this would be true.

User identifiers are name references at the end of a NamedChunk
These are accumulated and expanded by ``@@u`` reference

A reference command has the form ``@@<``\ *name*\ ``@@>``.  We accept three
tokens from the input, the middle token is the referenced name.

@}

An expression command has the form ``@@(``\ *Python Expression*\ ``@@)``.  
We accept three
tokens from the input, the middle token is the expression.

There are two alternative semantics for an embedded expression.

-   **Deferred Execution**.  This requires definition of a new subclass of ``Command``, 
    ``ExpressionCommand``, and appends it into the current ``Chunk``.  At weave and
    tangle time, this expression is evaluated.  The insert might look something like this:
    ``aChunk.append(ExpressionCommand(expression, self.location()))``.

-   **Immediate Execution**.  This simply creates a context and evaluates
    the Python expression.  The output from the expression becomes a ``TextCommand``, and
    is append to the current ``Chunk``.

We use the **Immediate Execution** semantics -- the expression is immediately appended
to the current chunk's text.

We provide a few elements of the ``os`` module.  We provide ``os.path`` library.
The ``os.getcwd()`` could be changed to ``os.path.realpath('.')``, but that seems too long-winded.

A double command sequence (``'@@@@'``, when the command is an ``'@@'``) has the
usual meaning of ``'@@'`` in the input stream.  We do this by appending text to
the last command in the current ``Chunk``.  This will append the 
character on the end of the most recent ``TextCommand`` or ``CodeCommand```; if this fails, it will
create a new, empty ``TextCommand`` or ``CodeCommand``.

**TODO:** This should be a method of a Chunk -- either append text, or append a command.

The ``expect()`` method examines the 
next token to see if it is the expected item. ``'\n'`` are absorbed.  
If this is not found, a standard type of error message is raised. 
This is used by ``handleCommand()``.

The ``load()`` method reads the entire input file as a sequence
of tokens, split up by the ``Tokenizer``.  Each token that appears
to be a command is passed to the ``handleCommand()`` method.  If
the ``handleCommand()`` method returns a True result, the command was recognized
and placed in the ``Web``.  If ``handleCommand()`` returns a False result, the command
was unknown, and we write a warning but treat it as text.

is that it's always loading a single top-level web.

The command character can be changed to permit
some flexibility when working with languages that make extensive

The Tokenizer Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``WebReader`` requires a tokenizer. The tokenizer breaks the input text
into a stream of tokens. There are two broad classes of tokens:

-   ``r'@@.'`` command tokens, including the structural, inline, and content
    commands.

-   ``r'\n'``. Inside text, these matter. Within structural command tokens, these don't matter.
    Except after the filename after an ``@@i`` command, where it ends the command. 

-   The remaining text; neither newlines nor commands.

The tokenizer works by reading the entire file and splitting on ``r'@@.'`` patterns.
The ``re.split()`` function will separate the input
and preserve the actual character sequence on which the input was split.
This breaks the input into blocks of text separated by the ``r'@@.'`` characters.

For example:

..  parsed-literal::

    >>> pat.split( "@@{hi mom@@}")
    ['', '@@{', 'hi mom', '@@}', '']
    
This tokenizer splits the input using ``r'@@.|\n'``. The idea is that 
we locate commands, newlines and the interstitial text as three classes of tokens.  
We can then assemble each ``Command`` instance from a short sequence of tokens.
The core ``TextCommand`` and ``CodeCommand`` will be a line of text ending with
the ``\n``. 

The tokenizer counts newline characters for us, so that error messages can include
a line number. Also, we can tangle extract comments into a file to reveal source line numbers.

Since the tokenizer is a proper iterator, we can use ``tokens = iter(Tokenizer(source))``
and ``next(tokens)`` to step through the sequence of tokens until we raise a ``StopIteration``
exception.

Other Application Components
----------------------------

There are a number of other components:

-   `Error class`_ Defines a uniform exception for this module.

-   `Action Class Hierarchy`_ defines the actions the application can perform.
    This includes loading the WEB file, weaving, tangling, and doing combinations of actions.
    
-   `The Application Class`_ is a high-level definition of the **py-web-lp** application as a whole.

-   `Logging setup`_ defines a handy context manager to configure and shut down logging.

-   `The Main Function`_ is a top-level function to create an instance of ``Application``,
    and execute it with either supplied arguments or (by default) the actual command-line
    arguments. This makes it easy to import and reuse ``main()`` in other applications.

Error class
~~~~~~~~~~~

An ``Error`` is raised whenever processing cannot continue.  Since it
is a subclass of Exception, it takes an arbitrary number of arguments.  The
first should be the basic message text.  Subsequent arguments provide 
additional details.  We will try to be sure that
all of our internal exceptions reference a specific chunk, if possible.
This means either including the chunk as an argument, or catching the 
exception and appending the current chunk to the exception's arguments.

The Python ``raise`` statement takes an instance of ``Error`` and passes it
to the enclosing ``try/except`` statement for processing.

The typical creation is as follows:

..  parsed-literal::

    raise Error(f"No full name for {chunk.name!r}", chunk)

A typical exception-handling suite might look like this:

..  parsed-literal::

    try:
        *...something that may raise an Error or Exception...*
    except Error as e:
        print(e.args) # this is a pyWeb internal Error
    except Exception as w:
        print(w.args) # this is some other Python Exception

The ``Error`` class is a subclass of ``Exception`` used to differentiate 
application-specific
exceptions from other Python exceptions.  It does no additional processing,
but merely creates a distinct class to facilitate writing ``except`` statements.


@d Error class -- defines the errors raised
@{
class Error(Exception): pass
@| Error @}

Action Class Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application performs three major actions: loading the document web, 
weaving and tangling.  Generally,
the use case is to perform a load, weave and tangle.  However, a less common use case
is to first load and tangle output files, run a regression test and then 
load and weave a result that includes the test output file.

The ``-x`` option excludes one of the two output actions.  The ``-xw`` 
excludes the weave pass, doing only the tangle action.  The ``-xt`` excludes
the tangle pass, doing the weave action.

This two pass action might be embedded in the following type of Python program.

..  parsed-literal::

    import pyweb, os, runpy, sys, pathlib, contextlib
    log = pathlib.Path("source.log")
    Tangler().emit(web)
    with log.open("w") as target:
        with contextlib.redirect_stdout(target):
            # run the app, capturing the output
            runpy.run_path('source.py')
            # Alternatives include using pytest or doctest
    Weaver().emit(web, "something.rst")


The first step runs **py-web-lp** , excluding the final weaving pass.  The second
step runs the tangled program, ``source.py``, and produces test results in
some log file, ``source.log``.  The third step runs **py-web-lp**  excluding the
tangle pass.  This produces a final document that includes the ``source.log`` 
test results.

To accomplish this, we provide a class hierarchy that defines the various
actions of the **py-web-lp**  application.  This class hierarchy defines an extensible set of
fundamental actions.  This gives us the flexibility to create a simple sequence
of actions and execute any combination of these.  It eliminates the need for a 
forest of ``if``-statements to determine precisely what will be done.

Each action has the potential to update the state of the overall
application.   A partner with this command hierarchy is the Application class
that defines the application options, inputs and results. 

@d Action class hierarchy -- used to describe actions of the application 
@{
@<Action superclass has common features of all actions@>
@<ActionSequence subclass that holds a sequence of other actions@>
@<WeaveAction subclass initiates the weave action@>
@<TangleAction subclass initiates the tangle action@>
@<LoadAction subclass loads the document web@>
@}


The ``Action`` class embodies the basic operations of **py-web-lp** .
The intent of this hierarchy is to both provide an easily expanded method of
adding new actions, but an easily specified list of actions for a particular
run of **py-web-lp** .

The overall process of the application is defined by an instance of ``Action``.
This instance may be the ``WeaveAction`` instance, the ``TangleAction`` instance
or a ``ActionSequence`` instance.

The instance is constructed during parsing of the input parameters.  Then the 
``Action`` class ``perform()`` method is called to actually perform the
action.  There are three standard ``Action`` instances available: an instance
that is a macro and does both tangling and weaving, an instance that excludes tangling,
and an instance that excludes weaving.  These correspond to the command-line options.

..  parsed-literal::

    anOp = SomeAction("name")
    anOp(*argparse.Namespace*)


The ``Action`` is the superclass for all actions.
An ``Action`` has a number of common attributes.

:name:
    A name for this action.
    
:options:
    The ``argparse.Namespace`` object.
    A LoadAction will update this with the ``Web`` object that was loaded.
    
!start:
    The time at which the action started.

The ``__call__()`` method does the real work of the action.
For the superclass, it merely logs a message.  This is overridden 
by a subclass.

@}

ActionSequence Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``ActionSequence`` defines a composite action; it is a sequence of
other actions.  When the macro is performed, it delegates to the 
sub-actions.

The instance is created during parsing of input parameters.  An instance of
this class is one of
the three standard actions available; it generally is the default, "do everything" 
action.

This class overrides the ``perform()`` method of the superclass.  It also adds
an ``append()`` method that is used to construct the sequence of actions.


@d ActionSequence subclass... 
@{
class ActionSequence(Action):
    """An action composed of a sequence of other actions."""
    def __init__(self, name: str, opSequence: list[Action] | None = None) -> None:
        super().__init__(name)
        if opSequence: self.opSequence = opSequence
        else: self.opSequence = []
        
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return "; ".join([str(x) for x in self.opSequence])
        
    @<ActionSequence call method delegates the sequence of ations@>
        
    @<ActionSequence summary summarizes each step@>
@| ActionSequence
@}

Since the macro ``__call__()`` method delegates to other Actions,
it is possible to short-cut argument processing by using the Python
``*args`` construct to accept all arguments and pass them to each
sub-action.

@d ActionSequence call... 
@{
def __call__(self, options: argparse.Namespace) -> None:
    super().__call__(options)

statistics for each step of this action.

@d ActionSequence summary... @{
def summary(self) -> str:
    return ", ".join([o.summary() for o in self.opSequence])
@| summary

WeaveAction Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``WeaveAction`` defines the action of weaving.  This action
logs a message, and invokes the ``weave()`` method of the ``Web`` instance.
This method also includes the basic decision on which weaver to use.  If a ``Weaver`` was
specified on the command line, this instance is used.  Otherwise, the first few characters
are examined and a weaver is selected.

This class overrides the ``__call__()`` method of the superclass.

If the options include ``theWeaver``, that ``Weaver`` instance will be used.
Otherwise, the ``web.language()`` method function is used to guess what weaver to use.

@d WeaveAction subclass... @{
class WeaveAction(Action):
    """Weave the final document."""
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__("Weave")
        
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.name!s} [{self.options.web!s}, {self.options.theWeaver!s}]"

    @<WeaveAction call method to pick the language@>
    
    @<WeaveAction summary of language choice@>
@| WeaveAction
@}

The language is picked just prior to weaving.  It is either (1) the language
specified on the command line, or, (2) if no language was specified, a language
is selected based on the first few characters of the input.

Weaving can only raise an exception when there is a reference to a chunk that
is never defined.

@d WeaveAction call... @{
def __call__(self, options: argparse.Namespace) -> None:
    super().__call__(options)
    if not self.options.weaver:

        self.logger.error("Problems weaving document from %r (weave file is faulty).", self.options.web.web_path)
        #raise

The ``summary()`` method returns some basic processing
statistics for the weave action.

        )
    return f"did not {self.name!s}"
@| summary
@}

TangleAction Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``TangleAction`` defines the action of tangling.  This operation
logs a message, and invokes the ``weave()`` method of the ``Web`` instance.
This method also includes the basic decision on which weaver to use.  If a ``Weaver`` was
specified on the command line, this instance is used.  Otherwise, the first few characters
are examined and a weaver is selected.

This class overrides the ``__call__()`` method of the superclass.

The options **must** include ``theTangler``, with the ``Tangler`` instance to be used.

@d TangleAction subclass... @{
class TangleAction(Action):
    """Tangle source files."""

    @<TangleAction summary method provides total lines tangled@>
@| TangleAction
@}

Tangling can only raise an exception when a cross reference request (``@@f``, ``@@m`` or ``@@u``)
occurs in a program code chunk.  Program code chunks are defined 
with any of ``@@d`` or ``@@o``  and use ``@@{`` ``@@}`` brackets.


@d TangleAction call... @{
def __call__(self, options: argparse.Namespace) -> None:

        )
    return f"did not {self.name!r}"
@| summary
@}


LoadAction Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``LoadAction`` defines the action of loading the web structure.  This action
uses the application's ``webReader`` to actually do the load.

An instance is created during parsing of the input parameters.  An instance of
this class is part of any of the weave, tangle and "do everything" action.

This class overrides the ``__call__()`` method of the superclass.

The options **must** include ``webReader``, with the ``WebReader`` instance to be used.


@d LoadAction subclass... @{
class LoadAction(Action):
    """Load the source web."""
    def __init__(self) -> None:

        return f"Load [{self.webReader!s}, {self.options.web!s}]"
        
    @<LoadAction call method loads the input files@>
    
    @<LoadAction summary provides lines read@>
@| LoadAction
@}

Trying to load the web involves two steps, either of which can raise 
exceptions due to incorrect inputs.

1.  The ``WebReader`` class ``load()`` method can raise exceptions for a number of 
    syntax errors as well as OS errors.

    -     Missing closing brackets (``@@}``, ``@@]`` or ``@@>``).

    -     Missing opening bracket (``@@{`` or ``@@[``) after a chunk name (``@@d`` or ``@@o``).

    -     Extra brackets (``@@{``, ``@@[``, ``@@}``, ``@@]``).

    -     Extra ``@@|``.

    -     The input file does not exist or is not readable.

2.  The ``Web`` class ``createUsedBy()`` method can raise an exception when a 
    chunk reference cannot be resolved to a named chunk.

@d LoadAction call... @{
def __call__(self, options: argparse.Namespace) -> None:

The Application Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Application`` class is provided so that the ``Action`` instances
have an overall application to update.  This allows the ``WeaveAction`` to 
provide the selected ``Weaver`` instance to the application.  It also provides a
central location for the various options and alternatives that might be accepted from
the command line.


The constructor creates a default ``argparse.Namespace`` with values
suitable for weaving and tangling.

The ``parseArgs()`` method uses the ``sys.argv`` sequence to 
parse the command line arguments and update the options.  This allows a
program to pre-process the arguments, passing other arguments to this module.


The ``process()`` method processes a list of files.  This is either
the list of files passed as an argument, or it is the list of files
parsed by the ``parseArgs()`` method.


The ``parseArgs()`` and process() functions are separated so that
another application can ``import pyweb``, bypass command-line parsing, yet still perform
the basic actionss simply and consistently.
For example:

..  parsed-literal::

    import pyweb, argparse
    
    p = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    *argument definition*
    config = p.parse_args()
    
    a = pyweb.Application()
    *Configure the Application based on options*
    a.process(config)


The ``main()`` function creates an ``Application`` instance and
calls the ``parseArgs()`` and ``process()`` methods to provide the
expected default behavior for this module when it is used as the main program.

The configuration can be either a ``types.SimpleNamespace`` or an
``argparse.Namespace`` instance.

The first part of parsing the command line is 
setting default values that apply when parameters are omitted.
The default values are set as follows:

:defaults:
    A default configuration.

:webReader:
    is the ``WebReader`` instance created for the current
    input file.
 
:doWeave:
    instance of ``Action``
    that does weaving only.

:doTangle:
    instance of ``Action``
    that does tangling only.
    
:theAction:
    is an instance of ``Action`` that describes
    the default overall action: load, tangle and weave.  This is the default unless
    overridden by an option.
    
Here are the configuration values. These are attributes
of the ``argparse.namespace`` default as well as the updated
namespace returned by ``parseArgs()``.

:verbosity:
    Either ``logging.INFO``, ``logging.WARN`` or ``logging.DEBUG``
    
:command:
    is set to ``@@`` as the  default command introducer.

:permit:
    The raw list of permitted command characters, perhaps ``'i'``.
    
:permitList:
    provides a list of commands that are permitted
    to fail.  Typically this is empty, or contains ``@@i`` to allow the include
    command to fail.

:files:
    is the final list of argument files from the command line; 
    these will be processed unless overridden in the call to ``process()``.

!skip:
    a list of steps to skip: perhaps ``'w'`` or ``'t'`` to skip weaving or tangling.
    
:weaver:
    the short name of the weaver.
    
:theTangler:
    is set to a ``TanglerMake`` instance 
    to create the output files.

:theWeaver:
    is set to an instance of a subclass of ``Weaver`` based on ``weaver``

The algorithm for parsing the command line parameters uses the built in
``argparse`` module.  We have to build a parser, define the options,
and the parse the command-line arguments, updating the default namespace.

We further expand on the arguments. This transforms simple strings into object
instances.

The ``process()`` function uses the current ``Application`` settings
to process each file as follows:

1.  Create a new ``WebReader`` for the ``Application``, providing
    the parameters required to process the input file.

2.  Create a ``Web`` instance, *w* 
    and set the Web's *sourceFileName* from the WebReader's *filePath*.

3.  Perform the given command, typically a ``ActionSequence``, 
    which does some combination of load, tangle the output files and
    weave the final document in the target language; if
    necessary, examine the ``Web`` to determine the documentation language.

4.  Print a performance summary line that shows lines processed per second.

In the event of failure in any of the major processing steps, 
a summary message is produced, to clarify the state of 
the output files, and the exception is reraised.
The re-raising is done so that all exceptions are handled by the 
outermost main program.

Logging Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We'll create a logging context manager. This allows us to wrap the ``main()`` 
function in an explicit ``with`` statement that assures that logging is
configured and cleaned up politely.

@d Imports...
@{import logging
import logging.config
@| logging logging.config
@}

This has two configuration approaches. If a positional argument is given,
that dictionary is used for ``logging.config.dictConfig``. Otherwise,
keyword arguments are provided to ``logging.basicConfig``.

A subclass might properly load a dictionary 
encoded in YAML and use that with ``logging.config.dictConfig``.

@d Logging Setup
@{
class Logger:
    def __init__(self, dict_config: dict[str, Any] | None = None, **kw_config: Any) -> None:
        self.dict_config = dict_config
        self.kw_config = kw_config
        
    def __enter__(self) -> "Logger":
        if self.dict_config:
            logging.config.dictConfig(self.dict_config)
        else:
            logging.basicConfig(**self.kw_config)
        return self
        
    def __exit__(self, *args: Any) -> Literal[False]:
        logging.shutdown()
        return False
@}

Here's a sample logging setup. This creates a simple console handler and 
a formatter that matches the ``basicConfig`` formatter.

This configuration dictionary defines the root logger plus some overrides for class loggers that might be
used to gather additional information.

@d Logging Setup
@{
default_logging_config = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False, # Allow pre-existing loggers to work.
    'style': '{',
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
            'stream': 'ext://sys.stderr',
            'formatter': 'basic',
        },
    },
    'formatters': {
        'basic': {
            'format': "{levelname}:{name}:{message}",
            'style': "{",
        }
    },
    
    'root': {'handlers': ['console'], 'level': logging.INFO,},
    
    # For specific debugging support...
    'loggers': {
        'Weaver': {'level': logging.INFO},
        'WebReader': {'level': logging.INFO},
        'Tangler': {'level': logging.INFO},
        'TanglerMake': {'level': logging.INFO},
        'indent.TanglerMake': {'level': logging.INFO},
        'Web': {'level': logging.INFO},
        # Unit test requires this...
        'ReferenceCommand': {'level': logging.INFO},
    },
}
@}

The above is wired into the application as a default. 
Exposing this via a configuration file is better.

@o pyweb.toml
@{
[pyweb]
# PyWeb options go here.

[logging]
version = 1
disable_existing_loggers = false

[logging.root]
handlers = [ "console",]
level = "INFO"

[logging.handlers.console]
class = "logging.StreamHandler"
stream = "ext://sys.stderr"
formatter = "basic"

[logging.formatters.basic]
format = "{levelname}:{name}:{message}"
style = "{"

[logging.loggers.Weaver]
level = "INFO"

[logging.loggers.WebReader]
level = "INFO"

[logging.loggers.Tangler]
level = "INFO"

[logging.loggers.TanglerMake]
level = "INFO"

[logging.loggers.indent.TanglerMake]
level = "INFO"

[logging.loggers.ReferenceCommand]
# Unit test requires this...
level = "INFO"

@}

We can load this with something like the following:

..  parsed-literal::

    config_path = Path("pyweb.toml")
    with config_path.open('rb') as config_file:
        config = toml.load(config_file)
    log_config = config.get('logging', {'version': 1, level=logging.INFO})

This makes it slightly easier to add and change debuging alternatives.
Rather then use the ``-v`` and ``-d`` options, the ``pyweb.toml`` 
provides a complete logging config. 

Also, we might want a decorator to define loggers more consistently for each class definition.

The Main Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The top-level interface is the ``main()`` function.
This function creates an ``Application`` instance.

The ``Application`` object parses the command-line arguments.
Then the ``Application`` object does the requested processing.
This two-step process allows for some dependency injection to customize argument processing.

We might also want to parse a logging configuration file, as well
as a weaver template configuration file.

@d Interface Functions
@{
def main(argv: list[str] = sys.argv[1:], base_config: dict[str, Any] | None=None) -> None:
    a = Application(base_config)
    config = a.parseArgs(argv)
    a.process(config)
@}

**pyWeb** Module File
------------------------

The **pyWeb** application file is shown below:

@o pyweb.py 
@{@<Overheads@>
@<Imports@>
@<Error class...@>
@<Base Class Definitions@>
@<Action class hierarchy...@>
@<Application Class...@>
@<Logging Setup@>
@<Interface Functions@>

def config() -> None:
    config_paths = Path("pyweb.toml"), Path.home()/"pyweb.toml"
    base_config: dict[str, Any] = {}
    for cp in config_paths:
        if cp.exists():
            with cp.open('rb') as config_file:
                base_config = toml.load(config_file)
            break
    log_config = base_config.get('logging', default_logging_config)
    with Logger(log_config):
        main(base_config=base_config.get('pyweb', {}))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    config()
@}

The `Overheads`_ are described below, they include things like:

-     shell escape

-     doc string

-     ``__version__`` setting


`Python Library Imports`_ are actually scattered in various places in this description.


The more important elements are described in separate sections:

-     Base Class Definitions

-     Application Class and Main Functions

-     Interface Functions

Python Library Imports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Numerous Python library modules are used by this application. 

A few are listed here because they're used widely. Others are listed
closer to where they're referenced.

-   The ``os`` module provide os-specific file and path manipulations; it is used
    to transform the input file name into the output file name as well as track down file modification
    times.

-   The ``time`` module provides a handy current-time string; this is used
    to by the HTML Weaver to write a closing timestamp on generated HTML files, 
    as well as log messages.
    
-   The ``datetime`` module is used to format times, phasing out use of ``time``.

-   The ``types`` module is used to get at ``SimpleNamespace`` for configuration.



@d Imports
@{import os
import time
import datetime
import sys
import types

if sys.version_info[:2] <= (3, 10):
    import tomli as toml
else:
    import tomllib as toml
@|  os time datetime toml types
@}

Note that ``os.path``, ``time``, ``datetime`` and ``platform```
are provided in the expression context.

Overheads
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shell escape is provided so that the user can define this
file as executable, and launch it directly from their shell.
The shell reads the first line of a file; when it finds the ``'#!'`` shell
escape, the remainder of the line is taken as the path to the binary program
that should be run.  The shell runs this binary, providing the 
file as standard input.


@d Overheads
@{#!/usr/bin/env python
@}

A Python ``__doc__`` string provides a standard vehicle for documenting
the module or the application program.  The usual style is to provide
a one-sentence summary on the first line.  This is followed by more 
detailed usage information.


@d Overheads 
@{"""py-web-lp Literate Programming.

Yet another simple literate programming tool derived from **nuweb**, 
implemented entirely in Python.
With a suitable configuration, this weaves documents with any markup language,
and tangles source files for any programming language.
"""
@}

The keyword cruft is a standard way of placing version control information into
a Python module so it is preserved.  See PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) #8 for information
on recommended styles.


We also sneak in a "DO NOT EDIT" warning that belongs in all generated application 
source files.

@d Overheads
@{__version__ = """3.2"""

### DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
### It was created by @(thisApplication@), __version__='@(__version__@)'.
### From source @(theFile@) modified @(datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(theFile)).ctime()@).
### In working directory '@(os.path.realpath('.')@)'.
@| __version__ @}

@| main @}

This can be extended by doing something like the following.

1.  Subclass ``Weaver`` create a subclass with different templates.

2.  Update the ``pyweb.weavers`` dictionary.

3.  Call ``pyweb.main()`` to run the existing
    main program with extra classes available to it.


..  parsed-literal::

    import pyweb
    class MyWeaver(HTML):
       *Any template changes*
     
    pyweb.weavers['myweaver']= MyWeaver()
    pyweb.main()


This will create a variant on **py-web-lp** that will handle a different
weaver via the command-line option ``-w myweaver``.
