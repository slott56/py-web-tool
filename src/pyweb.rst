Yet Another Literate Programming Tool
=================================================

Introduction
============

Literate programming was pioneered by Knuth as a method for
developing readable, understandable presentations of programs.
These would present a program in a literate fashion for people
to read and understand; this would be in parallel with presentation as source text
for a compiler to process and both would be generated from a common source file.

One intent is to synchronize the program source with the
documentation about that source.  If the program and the documentation
have a common origin, then the traditional gaps between intent 
(expressed in the documentation) and action (expressed in the
working program) are significantly reduced.

**py-web-lp** is a literate programming tool that combines the actions
of *weaving* a document with *tangling* source files.
It is independent of any source language.
While is designed to work with RST document markup, it should be amenable to any other
flavor of markup.
It uses a small set of markup tags to define chunks of code and 
documentation.

Background
-----------

The following is an almost verbatim quote from Briggs' *nuweb* documentation, 
and provides an apt summary of Literate Programming.

    In 1984, Knuth introduced the idea of *literate programming* and
    described a pair of tools to support the practise (Donald E. Knuth, 
    "Literate Programming", *The Computer Journal* 27 (1984), no. 2, 97-111.)
    His approach was to combine Pascal code with T\ :sub:`e`\ X documentation to
    produce a new language, ``WEB``, that offered programmers a superior
    approach to programming. He wrote several programs in ``WEB``,
    including ``weave`` and ``tangle``, the programs used to support
    literate programming.
    The idea was that a programmer wrote one document, the web file, that
    combined documentation written in T\ :sub:`e`\ X (Donald E. Knuth, 
    T\ :sub:`e`\ X book, Computers and Typesetting, 1986) with code (written in Pascal).

    Running ``tangle`` on the web file would produce a complete
    Pascal program, ready for compilation by an ordinary Pascal compiler.
    The primary function of ``tangle`` is to allow the programmer to
    present elements of the program in any desired order, regardless of
    the restrictions imposed by the programming language. Thus, the
    programmer is free to present his program in a top-down fashion,
    bottom-up fashion, or whatever seems best in terms of promoting
    understanding and maintenance.

    Running ``weave`` on the web file would produce a  T\ :sub:`e`\ X file, ready
    to be processed by  T\ :sub:`e`\ X. The resulting document included a variety of
    automatically generated indices and cross-references that made it much
    easier to navigate the code. Additionally, all of the code sections
    were automatically prettyprinted, resulting in a quite impressive
    document. 

    Knuth also wrote the programs for T\ :sub:`e`\ X and ``METAFONT``
    entirely in ``WEB``, eventually publishing them in book
    form. These are probably the
    largest programs ever published in a readable form.


Other Tools
------------

Numerous tools have been developed based on Knuth's initial
work.  A relatively complete survey is available at sites
like `Literate Programming <http://www.literateprogramming.com>`_,
and the OASIS
`XML Cover Pages: Literate Programming with SGML and XML <http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xmlLitProg.html>`_.

The immediate predecessors to this **py-web-lp** tool are
`FunnelWeb <http://www.ross.net/funnelweb>`_,
`noweb <http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/>`_ and 
`nuweb <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuweb/>`_.  The ideas lifted from these other
tools created the foundation for **py-web-lp**.

There are several Python-oriented literate programming tools.  
These include 
`LEO <http://personalpages.tds.net/~edream/front.html">`_,
`interscript <http://interscript.sourceforge.net/>`_,
`lpy <http://www.danbala.com/python/lpy/>`_,
`py2html <http://www.egenix.com/files/python/SoftwareDescriptions.html#py2html.py>`_,
`PyLit-3 <https://github.com/slott56/PyLit-3>`_

The *FunnelWeb* tool is independent of any programming language
and only mildly dependent on T\ :sub:`e`\ X.
It has 19 commands, many of which duplicate features of HTML or 
L\ :sub:`a`\ T\ :sub:`e`\ X.

The *noweb* tool was written by Norman Ramsey.
This tool uses a sophisticated multi-processing framework, via Unix
pipes, to permit flexible manipulation of the source file to tangle
and weave the programming language and documentation markup files.

The *nuweb* Simple Literate Programming Tool was developed by
Preston Briggs (preston@tera.com).  His work was supported by ARPA,
through ONR grant N00014-91-J-1989.  It is written
in C, and very focused on producing L\ :sub:`a`\ T\ :sub:`e`\ X documents.  It can 
produce HTML, but this is clearly added after the fact.  It cannot be 
easily extended, and is not object-oriented.

The *LEO* tool is a structured GUI editor for creating
source.  It uses XML and *noweb*\ -style chunk management.  It is more
than a simple weave and tangle tool.

The *interscript* tool is very large and sophisticated, but doesn't gracefully
tolerate HTML markup in the document.  It can create a variety of 
markup languages from the interscript source, making it suitable for
creating HTML as well as L\ :sub:`a`\ T\ :sub:`e`\ X.

The *lpy* tool can produce very complex HTML representations of
a Python program.  It works by locating documentation markup embedded
in Python comments and docstrings.  This is called "inverted literate
programming".

The *py2html* tool does very sophisticated syntax coloring.

The *PyLit-3* tool is perhaps the very best approach to Literate
programming, since it leverages an existing lightweight markup language
and it's output formatting. However, it's limited in the presentation order,
making it difficult to present a complex Python module out of the proper
Python required presentation.

**py-web-lp**
---------------

**py-web-lp** works with any
programming language. It can work with any markup language, but is currently
configured to work with RST.  This philosophy
comes from *FunnelWeb*
*noweb*, *nuweb* and *interscript*.  The primary differences
between **py-web-lp** and other tools are the following.

-   **py-web-lp** is object-oriented, permitting easy extension.
    *noweb* extensions
    are separate processes that communicate through a sophisticated protocol.
    *nuweb* is not easily extended without rewriting and recompiling
    the C programs.

-   **py-web-lp** is built in the very portable Python programming
    language.  This allows it to run anywhere that Python 3.3 runs, with
    only the addition of docutils.  This makes it a useful
    tool for programmers in any language.

-   **py-web-lp** is much simpler than *FunnelWeb*, *LEO* or *Interscript*.  It has
    a very limited selection of commands, but can still produce 
    complex programs and HTML documents.

-   **py-web-lp** does not invent a complex markup language like *Interscript*.
    Because *Iterscript* has its own markup, it can generate L\ :sub:`a`\ T\ :sub:`e`\ X or HTML or other
    output formats from a unique input format.  While powerful, it seems simpler to
    avoid inventing yet another sophisticated markup language.  The language **py-web-lp**
    uses is very simple, and the author's use their preferred markup language almost
    exclusively.

-   **py-web-lp** supports the forward literate programming philosophy,
    where a source document creates programming language and markup language.
    The alternative, deriving the document from markup embedded in 
    program comments ("inverted literate programming"), seems less appealing.
    The disadvantage of inverted literate programming is that the final document
    can't reflect the original author's preferred order of exposition,
    since that informtion generally isn't part of the source code.

-   **py-web-lp** also specifically rejects some features of *nuweb*
    and *FunnelWeb*.  These include the macro capability with parameter
    substitution, and multiple references to a chunk.  These two capabilities
    can be used to grow object-like applications from non-object programming
    languages (*e.g.* C or Pascal).  Since most modern languages (Python,
    Java, C++) are object-oriented, this macro capability is more of a problem
    than a help.

-   Since **py-web-lp** is built in the Python interpreter, a source document
    can include Python expressions that are evaluated during weave operation to
    produce time stamps, source file descriptions or other information in the woven 
    or tangled output.


**py-web-lp** works with any programming language; it can work with any markup language.
The initial release supports RST via simple templates.

The following is extensively quoted from Briggs' *nuweb* documentation, 
and provides an excellent background in the advantages of the very
simple approach started by *nuweb* and adopted by **py-web-lp**.

    The need to support arbitrary
    programming languages has many consequences:

    :No prettyprinting:
        Both ``WEB`` and ``CWEB`` are able to
        prettyprint the code sections of their documents because they
        understand the language well enough to parse it. Since we want to use
        *any* language, we've got to abandon this feature.
        However, we do allow particular individual formulas or fragments
        of L\ :sub:`a`\ T\ :sub:`e`\ X
        or HTML code to be formatted and still be part of the output files.

    :Limited index of identifiers:
        Because ``WEB`` knows about Pascal,
        it is able to construct an index of all the identifiers occurring in
        the code sections (filtering out keywords and the standard type
        identifiers). Unfortunately, this isn't as easy in our case. We don't
        know what an identifier looks like in each language and we certainly
        don't know all the keywords.  We provide a mechanism to mark 
        identifiers, and we use a pretty standard pattern for recognizing
        identifiers almost most programming languages.


    Of course, we've got to have some compensation for our losses or the
    whole idea would be a waste. Here are the advantages I [Briggs] can see:

    :Simplicity:
        The majority of the commands in ``WEB`` are concerned with control of the 
        automatic prettyprinting. Since we don't prettyprint, many commands are 
        eliminated. A further set of commands is subsumed by L\ :sub:`a`\ T\ :sub:`e`\ X  
        and may also be eliminated. As a result, our set of commands is reduced to 
        only about seven members (explained in the next section). 
        This simplicity is also reflected in the size of this tool, 
        which is quite a bit smaller than the tools used with other approaches.

    :No prettyprinting:
        Everyone disagrees about how their code should look, so automatic 
        formatting annoys many people. One approach is to provide ways to 
        control the formatting. Our approach is simpler -- we perform no 
        automatic formatting and therefore allow the programmer complete 
        control of code layout.

    :Control:
        We also offer the programmer reasonably complete control of the 
        layout of his output files (the files generated during tangling). 
        Of course, this is essential for languages that are sensitive to layout; 
        but it is also important in many practical situations, *e.g.*, debugging.

    :Speed:
        Since [**py-web-lp**] doesn't do too much, it runs very quickly.
        It combines the functions of ``tangle`` and ``weave`` into a single 
        program that performs both functions at once.

    :Chunk numbers:
        Inspired by the example of **noweb**, [**py-web-lp**] refers to all program code
        chunks by a simple, ascending sequence number through the file.  
        This becomes the HTML anchor name, also.

    :Multiple file output:
        The programmer may specify more than one output file in a single [**py-web-lp**]
        source file. This is required when constructing programs in a combination of 
        languages (say, Fortran and C). It's also an advantage when constructing 
        very large programs.

Installing
==========

This requires Python 3.10.

This is not (currently) hosted in PyPI. Instead of installing it with PIP,
clone the GitHub repository or download the distribution kit.

After downloading, install pyweb "manually" using the provided ``setup.py``.

::

    python setup.py install
    
This will install the ``pyweb`` module.

This depends on Jinja2 templates. The Jinja components should be installed
when ``setup.py`` uses ``requirements.txt`` to install the required components.

Using
=====

**py-web-lp** supports two use cases, `Tangle Source Files`_ and `Weave Documentation`_.
These are often combined to both tangle and weave an application and it's documentation.
The work starts with creating a WEB file with documentation and code.

Create WEB File
----------------

See `The py-web-lp Markup Language`_ for more details on the language.
For a simple example, we'll use the following WEB file: ``examples/hw.w``.

..  parsed-literal::

    ###########
    Hello World
    ###########
    
    This file has a *small* example.
    
    @d The Body Of The Script @{
    print("Hello, World!")
    @}
    
    The Python module includes a small script.
    
    @o hw.py @{
    @<The Body...@>
    @}

This example has RST markup document, that includes some ``@d`` and ``@o`` chunks
to define code blocks. The ``@d`` is the definition of a named chunk, ``The Body Of The Script``.
The ``@o`` defines an output file to be tangled. This file has a reference to
the ``The Body Of The Script`` chunk.

When tangling, the code will be used to build the file(s) in the ``@o`` chunk(s).
In this example, it will write the ``hw.py`` file by tangling the referenced chunk.

When weaving, the ``@d`` and ``@o`` chunks will have some additional RST markup inserted
into the document. The output file will have a name based on the source WEB document.
In this case it will be ``hw.rst``.


Tangle Source Files
-------------------

A user initiates this process when they have a complete ``.w`` file that contains 
a description of source files.  These source files are described with ``@o`` commands
in the WEB file.

The use case is successful when the source files are produced.

The use case is a failure when the source files cannot be produced, due to 
errors in the ``.w`` file.  These must be corrected based on information in log messages.

A typical command to tangle (without weaving) is:

..  parsed-literal::

    pyweb -xw examples/hw.w -o examples

The outputs will be defined by the ``@o`` commands in the source.
The ``-o`` option writes the resulting tangled files to the named directory.

Weave Documentation
-------------------

A user initiates this process when they have a ``.w`` file that contains 
a description of a document to produce.  The document is described by the entire
WEB file. The default is to use ReSTructured Text (RST) markup.
The output file will have the ``.rst`` suffix. 

The use case is successful when the documentation file is produced.

The use case is a failure when the documentation file cannot be produced, due to 
errors in the ``.w`` file.  These must be corrected based on information in log messages.

A typical command to weave (without tangling) is:

..  parsed-literal::

    pyweb -xt examples/hw.w -o examples
    
The output will be named ``examples/hw.rst``. The ``-o`` option made sure the file
was written to the ``examples`` directory.

Running **py-web-lp** to Tangle and Weave
-------------------------------------------

Assuming that you have marked ``pyweb.py`` as executable,
you do the following:

..  code:: bash

    pyweb examples/hw.w -o examples

This will tangle the ``@o`` commands in ``examples/hw.w``
It will also weave the output, and create ``examples/hw.rst``.
This can be processed by docutils to create an HTML file.

Command Line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the following command line options are accepted.


:-v:
    Verbose logging. 
    
:-s:
    Silent operation.

:-c *x*:
    Change the command character from ``@`` to ``*x*``.

:-w *weaver*:
    Choose a particular documentation weaver template. Currently the choices
    are ``rst``, ``tex``, and ``html``.

:-xw:
    Exclude weaving.  This does tangling of source program files only.

:-xt:
    Exclude tangling.  This does weaving of the document file only.

:-p *command*:
    Permit errors in the given list of commands.  The most common
    version is ``-pi`` to permit errors in locating an include file.
    This is done in the following scenario: pass 1 uses ``-xw -pi`` to exclude
    weaving and permit include-file errors; 
    the tangled program is run to create test results; pass 2 uses
    ``-xt`` to exclude tangling and include the test results.
    
:-o *directory*:
    The directory to which to write output files.

Bootstrapping
--------------

**py-web-lp** is written using **py-web-lp**. The distribution includes the original ``.w``
files as well as a ``.py`` module.

The bootstrap procedure is to run a "known good" ``pyweb`` to transform
a working copy into a new version of ``pyweb``. We provide the previous release in the ``bootstrap``
directory.

..  parsed-literal::

    python bootstrap/pyweb.py pyweb.w
    rst2html.py pyweb.rst pyweb.html
    
The resulting ``pyweb.html`` file is the updated documentation.
The ``pyweb.py`` is the updated candidate release of **py-web-lp**.

Similarly, the tests built from a ``.w`` files.

..  code:: bash

    python pyweb.py tests/pyweb_test.w -o tests
    PYTHONPATH=.. pytest
    rst2html.py tests/pyweb_test.rst tests/pyweb_test.html    

Dependencies
-------------

**py-web-lp** requires Python 3.10 or newer.

The following components are listed in the ``requirements.txt``
file. These can be loaded via

..  code:: bash
    
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    
This lp uses `Jinja <https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/>`_ for template processing.

The `tomli <https://pypi.org/project/tomli/>`_ library is used to parse configuration files
for older Python that lack a ``tomllib`` in the standard library.

If you create RST output, you'll want to use either `docutils <https://docutils.sourceforge.io>`_ or `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ to translate
the RST to HTML or LaTeX or any of the other formats supported by docutils or Sphinx.
This is not a proper requirement to run the tool. It's a common
part of an overall document production tool chain.

The overview contains PlantUML diagrams.
See https://plantuml.com/ for more information.
The `PlantUML for Sphinx <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/plantuml>`_ plug-in
can be used to render the diagrams automatically.

For development, additional components
like ``pytest``, ``tox``, and ``mypy`` are also used for development.

More Advanced Usage
===================

Here are two more advanced use cases.

Tangle, Test, and Weave with Test Results
-----------------------------------------

A user initiates this process when the final document should include test output 
from the source files created by the tangle operation. This is an extension to 
the example shown earlier.

..  parsed-literal::

    ###########
    Hello World
    ###########
    
    This file has a *small* example.
    
    @d The Body Of The Script @{
    print("Hello, World!")
    @}
    
    The Python module includes a small script.
    
    @o hw.py @{
    @<The Body...@>
    @}
       
    Example Output
    ==============
    
    @i examples/hw_output.log 


The use case is successful when the documentation file is produced, including
current test output.

The use case is a failure when the documentation file cannot be produced, due to 
errors in the ``.w`` file.  These must be corrected based on information in log messages.

The use case is a failure when the documentation file does not include current
test output.

The sequence is as follows:

..  parsed-literal::

    pyweb -xw -pi examples/hw.w -o examples
    python examples/hw.py >examples/hw_output.log
    pyweb -xt examples/hw.w -o examples
     
The first step uses ``-xw`` to excludes document weaving.
The ``-pi`` option will permits errors on the ``@i`` command. 
This is necessary in the event that the log file does not yet exist. 

The second step runs the test, creating a log file.  

The third step weaves the final document, including the test output file.
The ``-xt`` option excludes tangling, since output file had already been produced.


Template Changes
----------------

The woven document is based -- primarily -- on the text in the source WEB file.
This is processed using a small set of Jinja2 macros to modify behavior.
To fine-tune the results, we can adjust the templates used by this application.

The easiest way to do this is to work with the ``weave.py`` script which shows
how to create a customized subclass of ``Weaver``. 
The `Handy Scripts and Other Files`_ section shows this script and how it's build
from a few ``pyweb`` components.


.. py-web-tool/src/language.w

The **py-web-lp** Markup Language
==========================================

The essence of literate programming is a markup language that includes both code
from documentation. For tangling, the code is relevant. For weaving, both code
and documentation are relevant.

The source document is a "Web" documentation that includes the code.
It's important to see the ``.w`` file as the final documentation.  The code is tangled out 
of the source web.  

The **py-web-lp** tool parses the ``.w`` file, and performs the
tangle and weave operations.  It *tangles* each individual output file
from the program source chunks.  It *weaves* the final documentation file
file from the entire sequence of chunks provided, mixing the author's 
original documentation with some markup around the embedded program source.

Concepts
---------

The ``.w`` file has two tiers of markup in it.

-   At the top, it has **py-web-lp** markup to distinguish
    documentation chunks from code chunks. 
    
-   Within the documentation chunks, there can be 
    markup for the target publication tool chain. This might
    be RST, LaTeX, HTML, or some other markup language.
    
The **py-web-lp** markup decomposes the source document a sequence of *Chunks*.

..  uml::

    object web
    object chunk
    object documentation
    object "source code" as code
    
    web *-- chunk
    chunk *-- documentation
    chunk *-- code

The Web chunks have the following two overall sets of features:
 
-   Program source code to be *tangled* and *woven*. There are two important varieties: the "defined" chunks
    that are named, and the "output" chunks that define a file to be written. Program code chunks can have references
    to other defined code chunks. This permits created output files that tangled into a compiler-friendly
    order, separate from the presentation.

-   Documentation to be *woven*.  These are the blocks of text between commands.

The bulk of the file is typically documentation chunks that describe the program in
some publication-oriented markup language like RST, HTML, or LaTeX.

**py-web-lp** markup surrounds the code with "commands." Everything else is documentation.

The code chunks have two transformations applied.

- When Tangling, the indentation is adjusted to match the context in which they were originally defined. 
  This assures that Python (which relies on indentation)
  parses correctly. For other languages, proper indentation is expected but not required.

- When Weaving, selected characters can be quoted so they don't break the publication tool.
  For HTML, ``&``, ``<``, ``>`` are quoted properly. For LaTeX, a few escapes are used
  to avoid problems with the ``fancyvrb`` environment.

The non-code, documentation chunks are not transformed up in any way.  Everything that's not
explicitly a code chunk is output without modification.

All of the **py-web-lp** tags begin with ``@``. This is sometimes called the command prefix.
(This can be changed.) The tags were historically referred to as "commands."
For Python decorators in particular, the symbol must be doubled, ``@@``, because
all ``@`` symbols are commands, irrespective of context.

The *Structural* tags (historically called "major commands") partition the input and define the
various chunks.  The *Inline* tags are (called "minor commands") are used to control the
woven and tangled output from the defined chunks. There are *Content* tags which generate 
summary cross-reference content in woven files.

Boilerplate
-----------

There is some mandatory "boilerplate" required to make a working document.
Requirements vary by markup language.

LaTeX
~~~~~

The LaTeX templates use ``\\fancyvrb``.
The following is required.

::

    \\usepackage{fancyvrb}

Some minimal boilerplate document looks like this:

..  parsed-literal::
    
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{fancyvrb}
    \title{ *Title* }
    \author{ *Author* }
    
    \begin{document}
    
    \maketitle
    \tableofcontents

    *Your Document Starts Here*

    \end{document}

HTML
~~~~

There's often a fairly large amount of HTML boilerplate.
Currently, the templates used do **not** provide any CSS classes.
For more sophisticated HTML documents, it may be necessary to
provide customized templates with CSS classes to make the 
document look good.

Structural Tags
---------------

There are two definitional tags; these define the various chunks
in an input file. 

``@o`` *file* ``@{`` *text* ``@}``

    The ``@o`` (output) command defines a named output file chunk.  
    The text is tangled to the named
    file with no alteration.  It is woven into the document
    in an appropriate fixed-width font.
    
    There are options available to specify comment conventions
    for the tangled output; this allows inclusion of source
    line numbers.

``@d`` *name* ``@{`` *text* ``@}``

    The ``@d`` (define) command defines a named chunk of program source. 
    This text is tangled
    or woven when it is referenced by the *reference* inline tag.
    
    There are options available to specify the indentation for this
    particular chunk. In rare cases, it can be helpful to override
    the indentation context.

Each ``@o`` and ``@d`` tag is followed by a chunk which is
delimited by ``@{`` and ``@}`` tags.  
At the end of that chunk, there is an optional "major" tag.  

``@|``

    A chunk may define user identifiers.  The list of defined identifiers is placed
    in the chunk, separated by the ``@|`` separator.


Additionally, these tags provide for the inclusion of additional input files.
This is necessary for decomposing a long document into easy-to-edit sections.

``@i`` *file*

    The ``@i`` (include) command includes another file.  The previous chunk
    is ended.  The file is processed completely, then a new chunk
    is started for the text after the ``@i`` command.

All material that is not explicitly in a ``@o`` or ``@d`` named chunk is
implicitly collected into a sequence of anonymous document source chunks.
These anonymous chunks form the backbone of the document that is woven.
The anonymous chunks are never tangled into output program source files.
They are woven into the document without any alteration.

Note that white space (line breaks (``'\n'``), tabs and spaces) have no effect on the input parsing.
They are completely preserved on output.

The following example has three chunks:

..  parsed-literal::

    Some RST-format documentation that describes the following piece of the
    program.

    @o myFile.py 
    @{
    import math
    print( math.pi )
    @| math math.pi
    @}

    Some more RST documentation.

This starts with an anonymous chunk of
documentation. It includes a named output chunk which will write to ``myFile.py``.
It ends with an anonymous chunk of documentation.

Inline Tags
---------------

There are several tags that are replaced by content in the woven output.

``@@``

    The ``@@`` command creates a single ``@`` in the output file.
    This is replaced in tangled as well as woven output.

``@<``\ *name*\ ``@>``

    The *name* references a named chunk.
    When tangling, the referenced chunk replaces the reference command.
    When weaving, a reference marker is used.  For example, in RST, this can be 
    replaced with RST ```reference`_`` markup.
    Note that the indentation prior to the ``@<`` tag is preserved
    for the tangled chunk that replaces the tag.


``@(``\ *Python expression*\ ``@)``

    The *Python expression* is evaluated and the result is tangled or
    woven in place.  A few global variables and modules are available.
    These are described in `Expression Context`_.

Content Tags
---------------

There are three index creation tags that are replaced by content in the woven output.


``@f``

    The ``@f`` command inserts a file cross reference.  This
    lists the name of each file created by an ``@o`` command, and all of the various
    chunks that are concatenated to create this file.

``@m``

    The ``@m`` command inserts a named chunk ("macro") cross reference.  This
    lists the name of each chunk created by a ``@d`` command, and all of the various
    chunks that are concatenated to create the complete chunk.

``@u``

    The ``@u`` command inserts a user identifier cross reference. 
    This index lists the name of each chunk created by an ``@d`` command or ``@|``, 
    and all of the various chunks that are concatenated to create the complete chunk.


Additional Features
-------------------

**Sequence Numbers**. The named chunks (from both ``@o`` and ``@d`` commands) are assigned 
unique sequence numbers to simplify cross references.  

**Case Sensitive**. Chunk names and file names are case sensitive.

**Abbreviations**. Chunk names can be abbreviated.  A partial name can have a trailing ellipsis (...), 
this will be resolved to the full name.  The most typical use for this
is shown in the following example:

..  parsed-literal::

    Some RST-format documentation.

    @o myFile.py 
    @{
    @<imports of the various packages used@>
    print(math.pi,time.time())
    @}

    Some notes on the packages used.

    @d imports...
    @{
    import math,time
    @| math time
    @}

    Some more RST-format documentation.

This example shows five chunks.

1.  An anonymous chunk of documentation.

2.  A named chunk that tangles the ``myFile.py`` output.  It has
    a reference to the ``imports of the various packages used`` chunk.
    Note that the full name of the chunk is essentially a line of 
    documentation, traditionally done as a comment line in a non-literate
    programming environment.

3.  An anonymous chunk of documentation.

4.  A named chunk with an abbreviated name.  The ``imports...``
    matches the name ``imports of the various packages used``.  
    Set off after the ``@|`` separator is
    the list of user-specified identifiers defined in this chunk.

5.  An anonymous chunk of documentation.

Note that the first time a name appears (in a reference or definition),
it **must** be the full name.  All subsequent uses can be elisions.
Also not that ambiguous elision is an annoying problem when you 
first start creating a document.

**Concatenation**. Named chunks are concatenated from their various pieces.
This allows a named chunk to be broken into several pieces, simplifying
the description.  This is most often used when producing 
fairly complex output files.

..  parsed-literal::

    An anonymous chunk with some RST documentation.

    @o myFile.py 
    @{
    import math, time
    @}

    Some notes on the packages used.

    @o myFile.py
    @{
    print(math.pi, time.time())
    @}

    Some more HTML documentation.

This example shows five chunks.

1.  An anonymous chunk of documentation.

2.  A named chunk that tangles the ``myFile.py`` output.  It has
    the first part of the file.  In the woven document
    this is marked with ``"="``.

3.  An anonymous chunk of documentation.

4.  A named chunk that also tangles the ``myFile.py`` output. This
    chunk's content is appended to the first chunk.  In the woven document
    this is marked with ``"+="``.
    
5.  An anonymous chunk of documentation.

**Newline Preservation**. Newline characters are preserved on input.  
Because of this the output may appear to have excessive newlines.  
In all of the above examples, each
named chunk was defined with the following.

..  parsed-literal::

    @{
    import math, time
    @}

This puts a newline character before and after the import line.

Controlling Indentation
-----------------------

We have two choices in indentation:

-   Context-Sensitive.

-   Consistent.

If we have context-sensitive indentation, then the indentation of a chunk reference 
is applied to the entire chunk when expanded in place of the reference.  This makes it
simpler to prepare source for languages (like Python) where indentation
is important.

There are cases, however, when this is not desirable. There are some places in Python
where we want to create long, triple-quoted strings with indentation that does
not follow the prevailing indentations of the surrounding code. 

Here's how the context-sensitive indentation works.

..  parsed-literal::

    @o myFile.py 
    @{
    def aFunction(a, b):
        @<body of aFunction@>
    @| aFunction @}

    @d body...
    @{
    """doc string"""
    return a + b
    @}

The tangled output from this will look like the following.
All of the newline characters are preserved, and the reference to
*body of the aFunction* is indented to match the prevailing
indent where it was referenced.  In the following example, 
explicit line markers of ``~`` are provided to make the blank lines 
more obvious.

..  parsed-literal::

    ~
    ~def aFunction(a, b):
    ~        
    ~    """doc string"""
    ~    return a + b
    ~

[The ``@|`` command shows that this chunk defines the identifier ``aFunction``.]

This leads to a difficult design choice.

-   Do we use context-sensitive indentation without any exceptions?
    This is the current implementation. 
    
-   Do we use consistent indentation and require the author to get it right?
    This seems to make Python awkward, since we might indent our outdent a 
    ``@<`` *name* ``@>`` command, expecting the chunk to indent properly.

-   Do we use context-sensitive indentation with an exception indicator?
    This seems to go against the utter simplicity we're cribbing from **noweb**.
    However, it makes a great deal of sense to add an option for ``@d`` chunks to
    supersede context-sensitive indentation. The author must then get it right.
    
    The syntax to define a section looks like this: 
    
..  parsed-literal::

    @d -noindent some chunk name
    @{*First partial line*
    *More that uses """*
    @}
    
We might reference such a section like this.

..  parsed-literal::

    @d some bigger chunk...
    @{*code*
        @<some chunk name@>
    @}
    
This will include the ``-noindent`` section by resetting the contextual indentation
to zero. The *First partial line* line will be output after the four spaces 
provided by the ``some bigger chunk`` context. 

After the first newline (*More that uses """*) will be at the left margin.

Tracking Source Line Numbers
----------------------------

Since the tangled output files are -- well -- tangled, it can be difficult to
trace back from a Python error stack to the original line in the ``.w`` file that
needs to be fixed.

To facilitate this, there is a two-step operation to get more detailed information
on how tangling worked.

1.  Use the -n command-line option to get line numbers.

2.  Include comment indicators on the ``@o`` commands that define output files.

The expanded syntax for ``@o`` looks like this.

..  parsed-literal::

    @o -start /* -end \*/ page-layout.css
    @{
    *Some CSS code*
    @}
    
We've added two options: ``-start /*`` and ``-end */`` which define comment
start and end syntax. This will lead to comments embedded in the tangled output
which contain source line numbers for every (every!) chunk.

Expression Context
-------------------

There are two possible implementations for evaluation of a Python
expression in the input.

1.  Create an ``ExpressionCommand``, and append this to the current ``Chunk``.
    This will allow evaluation during weave processing and during tangle processing.  This
    makes the entire weave (or tangle) context available to the expression, including
    completed cross reference information.

2.  Evaluate the expression during input parsing, and append the resulting text
    as a ``TextCommand`` to the current ``Chunk``.  This provides a common result
    available to both weave and parse, but the only context available is the ``WebReader`` and
    the incomplete ``Web``, built up to that point.


In this implementation, we adopt the latter approach, and evaluate expressions immediately.
A global context is created with the following variables defined.

:os.path:
    This is the standard ``os.path`` module. 
    
:os.getcwd:
    The complete ``os`` module is not available. Just this function.
    
:datetime:
    This is the standard ``datetime`` module.
    
:time:
    The standard ``time`` module.

:platform:
    This is the standard ``platform`` module.

:__builtins__:
    Most of the built-ins are available, too. Not all. 
    ``exec()``, ``eval()``, ``open()`` and ``__import__()`` aren't available.

:theLocation:
    A tuple with the file name, first line number and last line number
    for the original expression's location.

:theWebReader:
    The ``WebReader`` instance doing the parsing.

:theFile:
    The ``.w`` file being processed.
    
:thisApplication:
    The name of the running **py-web-lp** application. It may not be pyweb.py,
    if some other script is being used.

:__version__:
    The version string in the **py-web-lp** application.

Architecture and Design Overview
================================

This application breaks the overall problem of literate programming into the following sub-problems.

1.	Representation of the WEB document as Chunks and Commands

2.	Reading and parsing the input WEB document.

3.	Weaving a document file.

4. 	Tangling the desired program source files.

Here's the overall Context Diagram for this.

..  uml:: 

    left to right direction
    skinparam actorStyle awesome
    
    actor "Developer" as Dev
    rectangle PyWeb {
        usecase "Tangle Source" as UC_Tangle
        usecase "Weave Document" as UC_Weave
    }
    rectangle IDE {
        usecase "Create WEB" as UC_Create
        usecase "Run Tests" as UC_Test
        usecase "Build Documentation" as UC_Doc
        usecase "Build Application" as UC_App
    }
    database WEB
    component App
    folder Documentation
    
    Dev --> UC_Create
    Dev --> UC_Test
    Dev --> UC_Doc
    Dev --> UC_App
    
    UC_Create --> WEB
    WEB --> UC_Tangle
    WEB --> UC_Weave
    
    UC_Tangle --> App
    UC_Weave --> Documentation
    
    UC_Test ..> UC_Tangle
    UC_Doc ..> UC_Weave
    UC_App ..> UC_Tangle

The idea here is a central WEB document contains both
the application source code and the documentation that
describes the code. The documentation can present
information in an order that's meaningful and helpful
to people; the tangling operation orders this for the benefit
of compilers and tools. 

Since this is often part of an Integrated Development
Environment (IDE), the container for
all of these software components is the developer's desktop.
(We don't need a diagram for that.)

Here's a summary of the application-level components.
These are the most visible libraries and command-line applications.

..  uml::

    component pyweb
    package jinja
    pyweb ..> jinja
    
    package templates
    pyweb *-- templates
    jinja ..> templates
    
    component weave
    weave ..> pyweb
    
    component tangle
    tangle ..> pyweb


The ``weave`` and ``tangle`` are convenient
scripts that import and customize the underlying ``pyweb`` application.
We've used the dotted "depends-on" arrow to depict this.
The ``pyweb`` application depends on Jinja2 to define the various templates
for weaving the output documents. 
The ``pyweb`` application contains the templates; this is shown
with a solid line.

We can modify the templates to alter the look and feel. The 
supplied ``weave.py`` script shows how to do this.

In many cases, the final production will multiple steps, 
as shown below:

..  uml::

     database WEB
     component pyweb
     artifact ".rst File" as RST
     component sphinx
     artifact ".html File" as HTML
     
     WEB --> pyweb
     pyweb --> RST
     RST --> sphinx
     sphinx --> HTML

We can use **pyweb-lp** to create an ``.rst`` file
with the documentation. This is then processed by Sphinx
to inject a Sphinx theme and necessary CSS to make
responsive web document(s). 

This is often automated with a ``Makefile``.

Overall Structure
-----------------

Generally, the code breaks into three functional areas

-   The core representation of a WEB.

-   A parser to read the source WEB.

-   The emitters to produce woven and tangled output, which include weavers and tanglers.

We could depict it as follows:

    
..  uml:: 
    
    folder core {
        class Web
        class Chunk
        abstract class Command
        Web *-- "1..*" Chunk
        Chunk *-- "1..*" Command
    }
    folder parser {
        class WebReader
        WebReader --> Web
    }
    folder emitters {
        abstract class Emitter
        class Tangler
        class Weaver
        Emitter <|-- Tangler
        Emitter <|-- Weaver
        Emitter --> Web
    }


We'll look at the core model, first.

Core WEB Representation
-----------------------



The basic structure has three layers, as shown in the following diagram:
    
..  uml:: 
    
    class Web << dataclass >> {
        chunks: list[Chunk]
    }
    class Chunk {
        name: str
        commands: list[Command]
    }
    abstract class Command
    
    Web *-- "1..*" Chunk
    Chunk *-- "1..*" Command
    
    class CodeChunk
    Chunk <|-- CodeChunk
    
    class NamedChunk 
    Chunk <|-- NamedChunk
    
    class OutputChunk
    Chunk <|-- OutputChunk
    
    class NamedCodeChunk 
    Chunk <|-- NamedCodeChunk
    
    class TextCommand
    Command <|-- TextCommand
    
    class CodeCommand
    Command <|-- CodeCommand
    
    class ReferenceCommand
    Command <|-- ReferenceCommand
    
    class XRefCommand
    Command <|-- XRefCommand
    
    class FileXRefCommand
    XRefCommand <|-- FileXRefCommand
    
    class MacroXRefCommand
    XRefCommand <|-- MacroXRefCommand
    
    class UseridXRefCommand
    XRefCommand <|-- UseridXRefCommand
     
The source document is transformed into a ``Web``, 
which is the overall container. The source is
decomposed into a sequence of ``Chunk`` instances.  Each ``Chunk`` is a sequence
of ``Commands``. 

``Chunk`` objects and ``Command`` objects cannot be nested, leading to delightful simplification.

The overall ``Web``
includes both the original sequence of ``Chunk`` objects as well as an index for the named ``Chunk`` instances.

Note that a named chunk may be created through a number of ``@d`` commands.
This means that
each named ``Chunk`` may be a sequence of definitions sharing a common name.
They are concatenated in order to permit decomposing a single concept into sequentially described pieces.
 
The various layers of ``Web``, ``Chunk``, and ``Command`` each have attributes designed
to be usable by a Jinja template when weaving output. When tangling, however, the only 
attribute that matters is the text contained in the ``@{`` and ``@}`` brackets.
This makes tangling somewhat simpler than weaving. 

There is a small interaction between a ``Tangler`` and each ``Chunk`` to work out the indentation.
based in the context in which a ``@< name @>`` reference occurs.

Reading and Parsing
--------------------

..  uml::

    class Web
    class WebReader {
        parse(source) : Web
    }
    WebReader ..> Web
    class Tokenizer 
    WebReader ..> Tokenizer
    
    class OptionParser
    
    class OptionDef
    
    OptionParser *-- OptionDef
    
    WebReader ..> OptionParser

A solution to the reading and parsing problem depends on a convenient 
tool for breaking up the input stream and a representation for the chunks of input 
and the sequence of commands.
Input decomposition is done with something we might call the **Splitter** design pattern. 

The **Splitter** pattern is widely used in text processing, and has a long legacy
in a variety of languages and libraries.  A **Splitter** decomposes a string into
a sequence of strings using some split pattern.  There are many variant implementations.
For example, one variant locates only a single occurence (usually the left-most); this is
commonly implemented as a Find or Search string function.  Another variant locates all
occurrences of a specific string or character, and discards the matching string or
character. 

The variation on **Splitter** in this application
creates each element in the resulting sequence as either (1) an instance of the 
split regular expression or (2) the text between split patterns.  

We define our splitting pattern with the regular
expression ``'@.|\n'``.  This will split on either of these patterns:

-	 ``@`` followed by a single character,

-	or, a newline.

For the most part, ``\n`` is only text, and as almost no special significance. The exception is the 
``@i`` *filename* command, which ends at the end of the line, making the ``\n``
significant syntax in this case.

We could be more specific with the following as a split pattern:
``'@[doOifmu\|<>(){}\[\]]|\n'``.  This would silently ignore unknown commands, 
merging them in with the surrounding text.  This would leave the ``'@@'`` sequences 
completely alone, allowing us to replace ``'@@'`` with ``'@'`` in
every text chunk. It's not clear this additional level of detail is helpful.

Within the ``@d`` and ``@o`` commands, there is a name and options. These follow
the syntax rules for Tcl or the shell. Optional fields are prefaced with ``-``.
All options must come before all positional arguments. The positional arguments
provide the name being defined. In effect, the name is ``' '.join(args.split(' ')``; 
this means multiple adjacent spaces in a name will be collapsed to a single space.

Emitters
--------

There are two possible outputs:

-   A woven document.

-   One or more tangled source files.

The overall structure of the classes is shown in the following diagram.

..  uml::
    
    class Web
    
    abstract class Emitter {
        emit(web)
    }
    
    Emitter ..> Web
    
    class Weaver
    Emitter <|-- Weaver
    
    class Tangler
    Emitter <|-- Tangler
    
    class TanglerMake
    Tangler <|-- TanglerMake
    
    abstract class ReferenceStyle
    Weaver --> ReferenceStyle
    
    class Simple
    ReferenceStyle <|-- Simple
    
    class Transitive
    ReferenceStyle <|-- Transitive
    
    class Template
    Weaver --> Template
    
    class "Jinja Macro" as macro
    Template *-- macro

We'll look at the weaving activity first, then
the tangling activity.

Weaving
---------

The weaving activity depends on having a target document markup language.
There are several approaches to this problem.  

-   We can use a markup language unique to **py-web-lp**.
    This would hide the final target markup language. It would mean
    that **py-web-lp** would be equivalent to a tool like Pandoc,
    producing a variety of target markup languages from a single, common source.
	
-   We can use any of the existing markup languages (HTML, RST, Markdown, LaTeX, etc.) 
    expand snippets of markup into author-supplied markup to create the 
    target woven document.

The problem with the first method is defining yet-another-markup-language.
This seems needlessly complex.

The problem with the second method is the source WEB file is a mixture of the following two things:

-   The background document in some standard markup and 

-   The code elements.

The code elements must be set off from the background text via some markup. In languages
like RST and Markdown, there's a small textual wrapper around code samples. In languages
like HTML, the wrapper can be much more complex. Also, certain code characters may need to be
properly escaped if the code sample happens to contain markup that should **not** be processed,
but treated as literal text.

The author should not be foreced to repeat the wrappers around each code examples. 
This should be delegated to the literate programming tool.
Further, the author should not be narrowly constrained by the markup injected
by the weaving process; the weaver should be extensible to add features. 

This leads to using the **Facade** design pattern. The weaver is
a **Facade** over the Jinja template engine. The tool provides default
templates in RST, HTML, and LaTeX. These can be replaced; new templates
can be added. The templates used to wrap code sections can be tweaked relatively easily.


Tangling
----------

The tangling activity produces output files.  In other tools,
some care was taken to understand the source code context for tangling, and
provide a correct indentation.  This required a command-line parameter
to turn off indentation for languages like Fortran, where identation
is not used.  

In **py-web-lp**, there are two options. The default behavior is that the
indent of a ``@< name @>`` command is used to set the indent of the 
material is expanded in place of this reference.  If all ``@<`` commands are presented at the
left margin, no indentation will be done.  This is helpful simplification,
particularly for users of Python, where indentation is significant.

In rare cases, we might need both, and a ``@d`` chunk can override the indentation
rule to force the material to be placed at the left margin.

Application
------------

The overall application has the following layers to it:
    
-   An ``Action`` class hierarchy that includes the actions of Load, Tangle, and Weave.

-   An overall ``Application`` class that executes the actions.

-   A top-level main function parses the command line, creates and configures the actions, and executes the sequence
    of actions.
    
The idea is that the Weaver Action should be visible to tools like `PyInvoke <https://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/stable/index.html>`_.
We want ``Weave("someFile.w")`` to be a sensible task.  

..  uml::

    abstract class Action
    
    class ActionSequence
    Action <|-- ActionSequence
    ActionSequence *-- "2..m" Action
    
    class LoadAction
    Action <|-- LoadAction
    
    class WeaveAction
    Action <|-- WeaveAction
    
    class TangleAction
    Action <|-- TangleAction
    
    class Application
    
    Application *-- Action

This shows the essential structure of the top-level classes.


.. py-web-tool/src/impl.w

Implementation
==============

The implementation is contained in a single Python module defining 
the all of the classes and functions, as well as an overall ``main()`` function.  The ``main()``
function uses these base classes to weave and tangle the output files.

The broad outline of the presentation is as follows:

-   `Base Classes`_ that define a model for the ``.w`` file.

    -   `Web Class`_ contains the overall Web of Chunks. A Web is a sequence
        of `Chunk` objects. It's also a mapping from chunk name to definition.
    
    -   `Chunk Class Hierarchy`_ are pieces of the source document, built into a Web.
        A ``Chunk`` is a collection of ``Command`` instances.  This can be
        either an anonymous chunk that will be sent directly to the output, 
        or a named chunks delimited by the structural ``@d`` or ``@o`` commands.
    
    -   `Command Class Hierarchy`_ are the items within a ``Chunk``. The text and
        the inline ``@<name@>`` references are the principle command classes.  
        Additionally, there are some cross reference commands (``@f``, ``@m``, or ``@u``).

-   `Output Serialization`_. This is the ``Emitter`` class
    hierarchy writes various kinds of files. 
    These decompose into two subclasses:
            
         -  A ``Tangler`` creates source code. 
         
         -  A ``Weaver`` creates documentation. The various Jinja-based templates
            are part of weaving.
         
-   `Input Parsing`_ covers deserialization from the source ``.w`` file
    to the base model of ``Web``, ``Chunk``, and ``Command``.
    
    -   `The WebReader class`_ which parses the Web structure.
    
    -   `The Tokenizer class`_ which tokenizes the raw input.
        
-   Other application components:
        
    -   `Error Class`_ defines an application-specific exception.
        This covers all of the various kinds of problems that might arise.

    -   `Action class hierarchy`_ defines things this program does.

Base Classes

Here are some of the base classes that define
the structure and meaning of a ``.w`` source file.

The above order is reasonably helpful for Python and minimizes forward
references. The ``Chunk``, ``Command``, and ``Web`` instances do have a circular relationship,
making a strict ordering a bit complex.

We'll start at the central collection of information, the ``Web`` class of objects.

Web Class
~~~~~~~~~

The overall web of chunks is contained in a 
single instance of the ``Web`` class that is the principle parameter for the weaving and tangling actions.  
Broadly, the functionality of a Web can be separated into the folloowing areas:

- It is constructed by a ``WebReader``.

- It also supports "enrichment" of the web, once all the ``Chunk`` instances are known. 
  This is a stateful update to the web.  Each ``Chunk`` is updated with 
  references it makes as well as references to it.

- It supports ``Chunk`` cross-reference methods that traverse this enriched data.
  This includes a kind of validity check to be sure that everything is used once
  and once only. 
  

Fundamentally, a ``Web`` is a hybrid list+mapping. It as the following features:

-   It's a ``Sequence`` to retain all ``Chunk`` instances in order.

-   It's a mapping of name-to-Chunk that also offers a 
    moderately sophisticated
    lookup, including exact match for a ``Chunk`` name and an approximate match for a
    an abbreviated name. 

The ``Web`` is built by the parser by loading the sequence of ``Chunk`` instances.

Note that the WEB source language has a "mixed content model". This means the code chunks
have specific tags with names. The text, on the other hand, is interspersed
among the code chunks. The text belongs to implicit, unnamed text chunks.

A web instance has a number of attributes.

:chunks:
    the sequence of ``Chunk`` instances as seen in the input file.
    To support anonymous chunks, and to assure that the original input document order
    is preserved, we keep all chunks in a master sequential list.

:files:
    the ``@o`` named ``OutputChunk`` chunks.  
    Each element of this  dictionary is a sequence of chunks that have the same name. 
    The first is the initial definition (marked with "="), all others a second definitions
    (marked with "+=").

:macros:
    the ``@d`` named ``NamedChunk`` chunks.  Each element of this 
    dictionary is a sequence of chunks that have the same name.  The first is the
    initial definition (marked with "="), all others a second definitions
    (marked with "+=").

:userids:
    the cross reference of chunks referenced by commands in other
    chunks.

This relies on the way a ``@dataclass`` does post-init processing.
One the raw sequence of ``Chunks`` has been presented, some additional
processing is done to link each ``Chunk`` to the web. This permits
the ``full_name`` property to expand abbreviated names to full names,
and, consequently, chunk references.

The class defines one visible element of a ``Web`` instance,
the ``chunks`` list of ``Chunk`` instances. From this list of
``Chunk`` objects, the remaining internal objects are built.
These include the following:
 
-  ``chunk_map`` has the mapping of chunk names to list of chunks that provide the definition for the chunk.

-   ``userid_map`` has the mapping of user-defined names to the list of chunks that define the name.

-   ``references`` is the set of all referenced chunks.

Additionally there are attributes to contain a logger, a reference to the WEB file path,
used to evaluate expressions, and a "strict-match" option that can report errors during
name resolution. Disabling this will allow documents to be tangled that are potentially
incomplete. 

Generally, a parser will create a list of ``Chunk`` objects. From this, the
parser can creates the final ``Web``.

The  ``__post_init__()`` special method populates the detailed structure of the WEB document. 
There are several passes through the WEB to digest the data:

1.  Set all ``Chunk`` and ``Command`` back references to the ``Web`` container.
    This is required so a ``Chunk`` with a ``ReferenceCommand`` instance can properly
    refer to a chunk elsewhere in the ``Web`` container. There are all weak
    references to faciliate garbgage collection.

2.  Locate the unabbreviated names in chunks and references to chunks.
    Names can found in two places. The ``@d`` command provides a name.
    A ``@<name@>`` command can also provide a reference to a name. 
    The unabbreviated names define the structure. Unambiguous abbreviations can be
    used freely, since full names are located first.

3.  Accumulate chunk lists, output lists, and name definition lists. This pass
    does two things. First any user-defined name after a ``@|`` command
    is accumulated. Second, any abbreviated name is resolved to the full name, 
    and the complete mapping from chunk name to a sequence of defining chunks is completed.

4.  Set the ``referencedBy`` attribute of a ``Chunk`` instance with all of the
    commands that point to it. The idea here is that a top-level ``Chunk`` instance
    may have references to other ``Chunk`` isntances. This forms a kind of tree.
    Any given low-level ``Chunk`` object is named by a sequence of parent ``Chunk`` objects.

Once the initialization is complete, the ``Web`` instance can be woven or tangled.

The representation of a ``Web`` instance is a sequence of ``Chunk`` instances.
This can be long and difficult to read. It is, however, complete, and can be 
used to build instances of ``Web`` objects from a variety of sources.

Name and Chunk resolution are similar.
Name resolution provides only the expanded name. 
Chunk resolution provides the list of chunks that define a name.
Chunk resolution expands on the basic features of Name resolution.

The complex ``target.endswith('...')`` processing only happens once
during ``__post_init__()`` processing. After the initalization is complete, 
all ``ReferenceCommand`` objects will have a ``full_name`` attribute
that avoids the complication of resolving a name with a ``...`` ellipsis.

The point of the ``Web`` object is to be able to manage a variety of 
structures. These iterator methods and properties provide the list of
``@o`` chunks, ``@d`` chunks, and the usernames after ``@|`` in a chunk.

Additionally, we can confirm the overall structure by asserting
that each ``@d`` name has one reference. A name with no references
indicates an omission, a name with multiple references suggests a spelling
or ellipsis problem.

A ``Web`` instance is built by a ``WebReader``. 
It's used by an ``Emitter``, including a ``Weaver`` as well as a ``Tangler``.
A ``Web`` is composed of individual ``Chunk`` instances.

Chunk Class Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``Chunk`` is a piece of the input file.  It is a collection of ``Command`` instances.
A ``Chunk`` can be woven or tangled to create output.

..  uml::

    class Chunk {
        name: str
        seq: int
        commands: list[Command]
        options: list[str]
        def_names: list[str]
        initial: bool
    }
    
    class OutputChunk
    Chunk <|-- OutputChunk
    
    class NamedChunk
    Chunk <|-- NamedChunk
    
These subclasss reflect three kinds of content in the WEB source document:

-  ``Chunk`` is the anonymous text context. 
        Text in the body generally becomes a ``TextCommand``.
        Also, the various XREF commands (``@m``, ``@f``, ``@u``) can *only* appear here.
        In principle, a ``@< reference @>`` can appear in text. 
        It must name a ``@d name @[...@]`` NamedDocumentChunk, which is expanded in place, not linked.

-  ``OutputChunk`` is the ``@o`` context. 
        Text in the body becomes a ``CodeCommand``.
        Any ``@< reference @>`` will be expanded when tangling, but become a link when weaving.
        This defines an output file.

-  ``NamedChunk`` is the ``@d`` context. 
        Text in the body becomes a ``CodeCommand``.
        Any ``@< reference @>`` will be expanded when tangling, but become a link when weaving.

Most of the attributes are pushed up to the superclass. This makes type checking the complex
WEB tree much simpler.

The attributes are visible to the Jinja templates. In particular the sequence number, ``seq``, 
and the initial definition indicator, ``initial``, are often used to customize presentation of the
woven content.

A ``type_is()`` method is used to discern the various subtypes. This slightly simplifies
the work done by a template. It's not easy to rely on proper inheritance because the templates
are implemented in a separate language with their own processing rules.

Command Class Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``Chunk`` is a sequence of ``Command`` instances. For the generic ``Chunk`` superclass,
the commands are -- mostly -- the ``TextCommand`` subclass of ``Command``.
These are blocks of text. A ``Chunk`` may also include some ``XRefCommand`` instances
which expand to cross-reference material for an index.

For the ``CodeChunk`` and ``NamedChunk`` subclasses, the commands are
``CodeCommand`` instances intermixed with ``ReferenceCommand`` instances.
A ``CodeCommand`` has a wrapper when weaving. Additionally, it will tangled
into the output. A ``ReferenceCommand`` becomes a link when weaving, and expands
to it's full body when being tangled. 

..  uml::

    class Chunk {
        name: str
        commands: list[Command]
    }
    abstract class Command {
        {static} has_name: bool
        {static} has_text: bool
        {static} typeid: TypeId
        text: str
        tangle(Tangler, Target)
    }

    class TextCommand

    XRefCommand <|-- UseridXRefCommand
    
    class TypeId {
        __getattr__(str) : bool
    }

    Command -- TypeId

Each of these variants has the possibility of distinct processing
when weaving the final document. The type information must be 
visibile to the Jinja template processing. This is done
through an instance of the ``TypeId`` class attached
to each of these classes.

The input stream is broken into individual commands, based on the
various ``@``\ *x* strings in the file.  There are several subclasses of ``Command``,
each used to describe a different command or block of text in the input.

All instances of the ``Command`` class are created by the ``WebReader`` instance.  
In this case, a ``WebReader`` can be thought of as a factory for ``Command`` instances.
Each ``Command`` instance is appended to the sequence of commands that
belong to a ``Chunk``.

This model permits two kinds of serialization:

-   Weaving a document from the WEB source file. This uses the various attributes
    of the various subclasses.

-   Tangling target documents with code. This relies on a ``tangle()`` method 
    in each subclass.

We'll address the run-time type identification first,
the the definitions of the various ``Command`` subclasses.

The TypeId Class
****************

The ``TypeId`` class provides run-time type
identification to the Jinja templates. The idea is ``object.typeid.AClass`` is 
equivalent to ``isinstance(object, pyweb.AClass)``. It has simpler syntax
and works better with Jinja templates. It helps sort out the various nodes of the AST
built from the source WEB document. 

There are three parts to the ``TypeId`` implementation:

-   A ``TypeId`` class definition to handle the attribute access.
    A reference to ``object.typeid.Name`` evaluates ``__getattr__(object, 'Name')``.
    
-   A metaclass definition, ``TypeIdMeta``, to inject the new ``typeid`` attribute into each class.

-   The normal class initialization process, which evaluates ``__set_name__()``
    for each attribute of a class that defines the method. This provides the
    containing class to the ``TypeId`` instance. 

The idea of run-time type identification is -- in a way -- a failure to properly
define the classes to follow the Liskov Substitution design principle. A better
design would check for specific features of a subclass of ``Command``.
This becomes awkwardly complex in the Jinja templates, because the templates exist
outside the class hierarchy. We rely on the ``typeid`` to map classes to macros appropriate to the class.

The ``TypeIdMeta`` metaclass sets the ``typeid`` attribute of each class defined by this metaclass. 
The ordinary class preparation will invoke
the ``__set_name__()`` special method to provide details to the attribute.

Once set, any reference to ``c.typeid.name`` will be evaluated as ``__getattr__(c, 'name')``.
This permits the typeid to compare the name provided by ``__set_name__()`` with the name
being inquired about.

The Command Class

The ``Command`` class is abstract, and describes 
most of the features of the various subclasses.

Output Serialization
--------------------

The ``Emitter`` class hierarchy writes the output from the source ``Web`` instance. 
An ``Emitter`` instance is responsible for control of an output file format.
This includes the necessary file naming, opening, writing and closing operations.

..  uml::

    abstract class Emitter {
        output: Path
        emit(Web)
    }
    
    class Web
    Emitter ..> Web
    
    class Weaver
    Emitter <|-- Weaver
    
    class Tangler
    Emitter <|-- Tangler
    class TanglerMake
    Tangler <|-- TanglerMake

        class Environment
    }
    
    Weaver --> Environment
    
    object template
    
    Weaver *-- template
    Environment --> template

Here's how the definitions are provided in the application.
The two reference class definitions are used by by the ``Emitter`` class, and needs to be defined first.
We'll look at them later, since they're a tiny strategy change in how cross-references
are displayed.

The Weaver Subclass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Weaver is a **Facade** that wraps Jinja template processing.

The job is to build the necessary environment, locate the templates, 
and then evaluate the template's ``generate()`` method to fill the values
into the template to create the woven document.

There's "base_weaver" template that contains the essential structure of
the output document. This creates the needed macros, and then weaves the various chunks, in order.

Each unique markup language has macros that provide the unique markup required for
the various chunks. This permits customization of the markup.  

We have an interesting wrinkle with RST-formatted output. There are two variants that may be important:

- When used with Sphinx, the "small" caption at the end of a code block uses ``..  rst-class:: small``.

- When used without Sphinx, i.e., native docutils, the the "small" caption at the end of a code block uses ``..  class:: small``.

This is a minor change to the template being used. The question is how to make that distinction
in the weaver? One view is to use subclasses of :py:class:`Weaver` for this.
However, the templates are found by name in the ``template_map`` within the ``Weaver``.
The ``--weaver`` command-line option provides the string (e.g., ``rst`` or ``html``) used
to build a key into the template map. 

We can, therefore, use the ``--weaver`` command-line option  to provide an expanded set of names for RST processing.

- ``-w rst`` is the Sphinx option.

- ``-w rst-sphinx`` is an alias for ``rst``. The dictionary key points to the same templates as ``rst``.

- ``-w rst-nosphinx`` is the "pure-docutils" version, using ``.. class::``. 

- ``-w rst-docutils`` is an alias for the nosphinx option.

While this works out nicely, it turns out that the ``..  container:: small`` is, perhaps, a better
markup that ``..  class:: small``. This work in docutils **and** Sphinx.

There are several strategy plug-ins. Each is unique for a particular flavort of markup.
These include the quoting function used to escape markup characters,
and the templates used.

The objective is to have a generic "weaver" template which includes three levels
of template definition:

1. Defaults.
2. Configured overrides, perhaps from ``pyweb.toml``.
3. Document overrides from the ``.w`` file in ``@t name @{...@}`` commands.

This means there is a two-step binding between document and macros.

1. The base weaver document should import three generic template definitions:

    ``{%- from 'markup' import * %}``

    ``{%- from 'configured' import * %}``

    ``{%- from 'document' import * %}``

2. These names map (*somehow*) to specific templates based on markup language.
    ``markup`` -> ``rst/markup``, etc.
    
This allows us to provide all templates and make a final binding
at weave time. We can use a prefix loader with a given prefix.
Some kind of "import rst/markup as markup" would be ideal. 

Jinja, however, doesn't seem to support this the same way Python does.
There's no ``import as`` construct allowing very late binding.
 
The alternative is to 
create the environment very late in the process, once we have all the information
available. We can then pick the templates to put into a DictLoader to support
the standard weaving structure.

The quoting rules apply to the various
template languages. The idea is that
a few characters must be escaped for
proper presentation in the code sample sections.

Common Base Template
********************

The common base template expands each chunk and each command in order.
This involves some special case processing for ``OutputChunk`` and ``NamedChunk``
which have a "wrapper" woven around the chunk's sequence of commands.

This relies on a number of individual macros:

-   text(command). Emits a block of text -- this should do *nothing* with the text. The author's original
    markup passes through untouched.
    
-   begin_code(chunk). Starts a block of code, either ``@d`` or ``@o``.
 
-   code(command). Emits a block fo code. This may require escapes for special characters that would break
    the markup being used.
    
-   ref(command). Emits a reference to a named block of code. 

-   end_code(chunk). Ends a block of code.

-   file_xref(command). Emit the full ``@f`` output, usually some kind of definition list.

-   macro_xref(command). Emit the full ``@m`` output, usually some kind of definition list.

-   userid_xref(command). Emit the full ``@u`` output, usually some kind of definition list.

The ``ref()`` macro can also be used in the XREF output macros. It can also be used in the ``end_code()`` macro.
After a block of code, some tools (like Interscript) will show where the block was referenced.
The point of using the ``ref()`` macro in multiple places is to make all of them look identical.

There are a variety of optional formatting considerations. First is cross-references,
second is a variety of ``begin_code()`` options.


There are four styles for the "referencedBy" information in a ``Chunk``.

-   Nothing. 

-   The immediate ``@<name@>`` Chunk.

-   The entire transitive sequence of parents for the ``@<name@>`` Chunk. There
    are two forms for this:
    
    -   Top-down path. ``→ Named (1) / → Sub-Named (2) / → Sub-Sub-Named (3)``.
    
    -   Bottom-up path.  ``→ Sub-Sub-Named (3) ∈ → Sub-Named (2) ∈ → Named (1)``.

These require four distinct versions of the ``end_code()`` macro. This macro uses the ``transitive_referencedBy``
propery of a ``Chunk`` producing a sequence of ``ref()`` values.

**TODO:** Need to more gracefully handle the case where an output chunk
has multiple definitions. 

..  parsed-literal::

    @o x.y
    @{
    ... part 1 ...
    @}
    
    @o x.y
    @{
    ... part 2 ...
    @}
    
The above should have the same output as the follow (more complex) alternative: 

..  parsed-literal::

    @o x.y
    @{
    @<part 1@>
    @<part 2@>
    @}
    
    @d part 1
    @{
    ... part 1 ...
    @}

    @d part 2
    @{
    ... part 2 ...
    @}

Currently, we casually treat the first instance
as the "definition", and don't provide references
to the additional parts of the definition.

The Tangler Subclasses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tangling is a variation on emitting that includes all the code in the order
defined by the ``@o`` file commands. This is not necessarily the order
they're presented in the document.

The whole point of Weaving and Tangling is to write a document in an order that's
sensible for people to understand. The tangled output is for compilers
and run-time environments.

Each file is individually tangled, unrelated to the order of the source
WEB document. The ``emit()`` process, therefore, iterates through all
of the files defined in the WEB.

There's a complex interplay between ``Tangler`` and ``CodeCommand``
to maintain the indentations.

..  uml::

    participant Tangler
    
    participant ReferenceCommand
    
    participant Command
    
    Tangler --> ReferenceCommand : tangle()
    ReferenceCommand --> Tangler : get len(fragment)
    ReferenceCommand --> Tangler : addIndent(i)
    group [for all] commands in the referenced chunk
        ReferenceCommand --> Command : tangle()
    end 
    ReferenceCommand --> Tangler : clrIndent()

This approach can preserves the indentation in front of a ``@< reference @>`` command.

The ``codeBlock()`` method is used by each block of code tangled into 
a document. There are two sources of indentation:

-   A ``Chunk`` can provide an indent setting as an option. This is provided by the ``indent`` attribute
    of the tangle context. If specified, this is the indentation. 
    
-   A ``@< name @>`` ``ReferenceCommand`` may be indented. This will be in a ``Chunk`` as the following three commands:

    1.  A ``CodeCommand`` with only spaces and no trailing ``\n``. 
        The indent is buffered -- not written -- and the ``fragment`` attribute is set.
    
    2.  The ``ReferenceCommand``. This interpolates text from a ``NamedChunk`` using the prevailing indent.
        The ``tangle()`` method uses ``addIndent()`` and ``clrIndent()`` to mark this. The processing depends 
        on this tangler's ``fragment`` attribute to provide the pending indentation; the ``addIndent()`` 
        must consume the fragment to prevent confusion with subsequent indentations.
    
    3.  A ``CodeCommand`` with a trailing ``\n``. (Often it's only the newline.)  If the ``fragment`` attribute
        is set, there's a pending indentation that hasn't yet been written.
        This can happen with there's a ``@@`` command at the left end of a line; often a Python decorator. 
        The fragment is written and the ``fragment`` attribute cleared.  No ``addIdent()`` will have
        been done to consume the fragment. 
    
While the WEB language permits multiple ``@<name@> @<name@>`` on a single line,
this is odd and potentially confusing. It isn't clear how the second reference
should be indented.

The ``ReferenceCommand`` ``tangle()`` implementation handles much of this. 
The following two rules apply:
    
-   A line of text that does not end with a newline, sets a new prevailing indent
    for the following command(s).

-   A line of text ending with a newline resets the prevailing indent.

This a stack, maintained by the Tangler.

The ``addIndent()`` increments the indent. 
Used by ``@<name@>`` to set a prevailing indent.

The ``setIndent()`` pushes a fixed indent instead adding an increment. 
Used by a ``Chunk`` with an ``-indent`` option.
    
The ``clrIndent()`` method discards the most recent indent from the context stack.  
This is used when finished
tangling a source chunk.  This restores the indent to the prevailing indent.

The ``resetIndent()`` method removes all indent context information and resets the indent
to a default.

Input Parsing
-------------

There are three tiers to the input parsing:

-   A base tokenizer.

=   Additionally, a separate parser is used for options in ``@d`` and ``@o`` commands.

-   The overall ``WebReader`` class.


..  uml::

    class WebReader {
        load(path) : Web
        parse_source()
    }
    
    class Tokenizer <<Iterator>> {
        __next__(self) : str
    }
        
    WebReader --> Tokenizer
    WebReader --> WebReader : "parent"
    WebReader --> argparse.ArgumentParser
    
We'll start with the ``WebReader`` class definition

The WebReader Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two forms of the constructor for a ``WebReader``.  The 
initial ``WebReader`` instance is created with code like the following:


..  parsed-literal::

    p = WebReader()
    p.command = options.commandCharacter 

This will define the command character; usually provided as a command-line parameter to the application.

When processing an include file (with the ``@i`` command), a child ``WebReader``
instance is created with code like the following:

..  parsed-literal::

    c = WebReader(parent=parentWebReader)


This will inherit the configuration from the parent ``WebReader``.  
This will also include a  reference from child to parent so that embedded Python expressions
can view the entire input context.

The ``WebReader`` class parses the input file into command blocks.
These are assembled into ``Chunks``, and the ``Chunks`` are assembled into the document
``Web``.  Once this input pass is complete, the resulting ``Web`` can be tangled or
woven.

The commands have three general types:

-   "Structural" commands define the structure of the ``Chunks``.  The  structural commands 
    are ``@d`` and ``@o``, as well as the ``@{``, ``@}``, ``@[``, ``@]`` brackets, 
    and the ``@i`` command to include another file.

-   "Inline" commands are inline within a ``Chunk``: they define internal ``Commands``.  
    Blocks of text are minor commands, as well as the ``@<``\ *name*\ ``@>`` references.
    The ``@@`` escape is also
    handled here so that all further processing is independent of any parsing.

-   "Content" commands generate woven content. These include 
    the various cross-reference commands (``@f``, ``@m`` and ``@u``).  

There are two class-level ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` instances used by this class.

:output_option_parser:
    An ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` used to parse the ``@o`` command's options.
    
:definition_option_parser:
    An ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` used to parse the ``@d`` command's options.

The class has the following attributes:

:parent:
    is the outer ``WebReader`` when processing a ``@i`` command.

:command:
    is the command character; a WebReader will use the parent command 
    character if the parent is not ``None``. Default is ``@``.

:permitList:
    is the list of commands that are permitted to fail.  This is generally 
    an empty list or ``('@i',)``.

:_source:
    The open file-like object being used by ``load()``.
    
:filePath:
    The path being processed; this provides a visible file name.

:tokenizer:
    An instance of ``Tokenizer`` used to parse the input. This is built
    when ``load()`` is called.
    
:totalLines:
:totalFiles:
:errors:
    Summary counts.

The reader maintains a context into which constructs are added.
The ``Web`` contains ``Chunk`` instances in ``self.web.chunks``.
The current chunk is ``self.web.chunks[-1]``.
Each ``Chunk``, similarly, has a command context in ``chunk.commands[-1]``.

This works because the language is "flat": there are no nested ``@d`` or ``@o``
chunks.

Command recognition is done via a **Chain of Command**-like design.
There are two conditions: the command string is recognized or it is not recognized.
If the command is recognized, ``handleCommand()`` will do one of the following:

-   For "structural" commands, it will attach the current ``Chunk`` (*self.aChunk*) to the 
    current ``Web`` (*self.aWeb*), and start a new ``Chunk``. This becomes the context
    for processing commands. By default an anonymous ``Chunk`` used to accumulate text
    is available for all of the content outside named chunks.

-   For "inline" and "content" commands, create a ``Command``, attach it to the current 
    ``Chunk`` (*self.aChunk*).

If the command is not recognized, ``handleCommand()`` returns false, and this is a syntax error.

A subclass can override ``handleCommand()`` to 

(1) Evaluate this superclass version;

(2) If the command is unknown to the superclass, 
    then the subclass can process it;

(3) If the command is unknown to both classes, 
    then return ``False``.  Either a subclass will handle it, or the default activity taken
    by ``load()`` is to treat the command as a syntax error.

The ``handleCommand()`` implementation is a massive ``match`` statement.
It might be a good idea to decompose this into a number of separate methods.
This would make the ``match`` statement shorter and easier to understand.

An output chunk has the form ``@o`` *name* ``@{`` *content* ``@}``.
We use the first two tokens to name the ``OutputChunk``.  We expect
the ``@{`` separator.  We then attach all subsequent commands
to this chunk while waiting for the final ``@}`` token to end the chunk.

We'll use an ``ArgumentParser`` to locate the optional parameters.  This will then let
us build an appropriate instance of ``OutputChunk``.

A named chunk has the form ``@d`` *name* ``@{`` *content* ``@}`` for
code and ``@d`` *name* ``@[`` *content* ``@]`` for document source.
We use the first two tokens to name the ``NamedChunk`` or ``NamedDocumentChunk``.

Then we can use the ``options`` value to create an appropriate subclass of ``NamedChunk``.

If both are in the options, we should provide a warning.

An import command has the unusual form of ``@i`` *name*, with no trailing
separator.  When we encounter the ``@i`` token, the next token will start with the
file name, but may continue with an anonymous chunk.  To avoid confusion,
we require that all ``@i`` commands occur at the end of a line, 
The break on the ``'\n'`` which ends the file name.
This permits file names with embedded spaces. It also permits arguments and options,
if really necessary.

Once we have split the file name away from the rest of the following anonymous chunk,
we push the following token (a ``\n``) back into the token stream, so that it will be the 
first token examined at the top of the ``load()`` loop.

We create a child ``WebReader`` instance to process the included file.  The entire file 
is loaded into the current ``Web`` instance.  A new, empty ``Chunk`` is created at the end
of the file so that processing can resume with an anonymous ``Chunk``.

The reader has a ``permitList`` attribute.
This lists any commands where failure is permitted.  Currently, only the ``@i`` command
can be set to permit failure; this allows a ``.w`` to include
a file that does not yet exist.  
 
The primary use case for this permitted error feature is when weaving test output.
A first use of the **py-web-lp** can be used to tangle the program source files,
ignoring a missing test output file, named in an ``@i`` command.
The application can then be run to create the missing test output file. 
After this, a second use of the **py-web-lp**
can weave the test output file into a final, complete document.

When a ``@}`` or ``@]`` are found, this finishes a named chunk.  The next
text is therefore part of an anonymous chunk.

Note that no check is made to assure that the previous ``Chunk`` was indeed a named
chunk or output chunk started with ``@{`` or ``@[``.  
To do this, an attribute would be
needed for each ``Chunk`` subclass that indicated if a trailing bracket was necessary.
For the base ``Chunk`` class, this would be false, but for all other subclasses of
``Chunk``, this would be true.

An expression command has the form ``@(``\ *Python Expression*\ ``@)``.  
We accept three
tokens from the input, the middle token is the expression.

There are two alternative semantics for an embedded expression.

-   **Deferred Execution**.  This requires definition of a new subclass of ``Command``, 
    ``ExpressionCommand``, and appends it into the current ``Chunk``.  At weave and
    tangle time, this expression is evaluated.  The insert might look something like this:
    ``aChunk.append(ExpressionCommand(expression, self.location()))``.

-   **Immediate Execution**.  This simply creates a context and evaluates
    the Python expression.  The output from the expression becomes a ``TextCommand``, and
    is append to the current ``Chunk``.

We use the **Immediate Execution** semantics -- the expression is immediately appended
to the current chunk's text.

We provide a few elements of the ``os`` module.  We provide ``os.path`` library.
The ``os.getcwd()`` could be changed to ``os.path.realpath('.')``, but that seems too long-winded.

The Tokenizer Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``WebReader`` requires a tokenizer. The tokenizer breaks the input text
into a stream of tokens. There are two broad classes of tokens:

-   ``r'@.'`` command tokens, including the structural, inline, and content
    commands.

-   ``r'\n'``. Inside text, these matter. Within structural command tokens, these don't matter.
    Except after the filename after an ``@i`` command, where it ends the command. 

-   The remaining text; neither newlines nor commands.

The tokenizer works by reading the entire file and splitting on ``r'@.'`` patterns.
The ``re.split()`` function will separate the input
and preserve the actual character sequence on which the input was split.
This breaks the input into blocks of text separated by the ``r'@.'`` characters.

For example:

..  parsed-literal::

    >>> pat.split( "@{hi mom@}")
    ['', '@{', 'hi mom', '@}', '']
    
This tokenizer splits the input using ``r'@.|\n'``. The idea is that 
we locate commands, newlines and the interstitial text as three classes of tokens.  
We can then assemble each ``Command`` instance from a short sequence of tokens.
The core ``TextCommand`` and ``CodeCommand`` will be a line of text ending with
the ``\n``. 

The tokenizer counts newline characters for us, so that error messages can include
a line number. Also, we can tangle extract comments into a file to reveal source line numbers.

Since the tokenizer is a proper iterator, we can use ``tokens = iter(Tokenizer(source))``
and ``next(tokens)`` to step through the sequence of tokens until we raise a ``StopIteration``
exception.

Other Application Components
----------------------------

There are a number of other components:

-   `Error class`_ Defines a uniform exception for this module.

-   `Action Class Hierarchy`_ defines the actions the application can perform.
    This includes loading the WEB file, weaving, tangling, and doing combinations of actions.
    
-   `The Application Class`_ is a high-level definition of the **py-web-lp** application as a whole.

-   `Logging setup`_ defines a handy context manager to configure and shut down logging.

-   `The Main Function`_ is a top-level function to create an instance of ``Application``,
    and execute it with either supplied arguments or (by default) the actual command-line
    arguments. This makes it easy to import and reuse ``main()`` in other applications.

Error class
~~~~~~~~~~~

An ``Error`` is raised whenever processing cannot continue.  Since it
is a subclass of Exception, it takes an arbitrary number of arguments.  The
first should be the basic message text.  Subsequent arguments provide 
additional details.  We will try to be sure that
all of our internal exceptions reference a specific chunk, if possible.
This means either including the chunk as an argument, or catching the 
exception and appending the current chunk to the exception's arguments.

The Python ``raise`` statement takes an instance of ``Error`` and passes it
to the enclosing ``try/except`` statement for processing.

The typical creation is as follows:

..  parsed-literal::

    raise Error(f"No full name for {chunk.name!r}", chunk)

A typical exception-handling suite might look like this:

..  parsed-literal::

    try:
        *...something that may raise an Error or Exception...*
    except Error as e:
        print(e.args) # this is a pyWeb internal Error
    except Exception as w:
        print(w.args) # this is some other Python Exception

The ``Error`` class is a subclass of ``Exception`` used to differentiate 
application-specific
exceptions from other Python exceptions.  It does no additional processing,
but merely creates a distinct class to facilitate writing ``except`` statements.



..  _`Error class defines the errors raised (52)`:

Action Class Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application performs three major actions: loading the document web, 
weaving and tangling.  Generally,
the use case is to perform a load, weave and tangle.  However, a less common use case
is to first load and tangle output files, run a regression test and then 
load and weave a result that includes the test output file.

The ``-x`` option excludes one of the two output actions.  The ``-xw`` 
excludes the weave pass, doing only the tangle action.  The ``-xt`` excludes
the tangle pass, doing the weave action.

This two pass action might be embedded in the following type of Python program.

..  parsed-literal::

    import pyweb, os, runpy, sys, pathlib, contextlib
    log = pathlib.Path("source.log")
    Tangler().emit(web)
    with log.open("w") as target:
        with contextlib.redirect_stdout(target):
            # run the app, capturing the output
            runpy.run_path('source.py')
            # Alternatives include using pytest or doctest
    Weaver().emit(web, "something.rst")


The first step runs **py-web-lp** , excluding the final weaving pass.  The second
step runs the tangled program, ``source.py``, and produces test results in
some log file, ``source.log``.  The third step runs **py-web-lp**  excluding the
tangle pass.  This produces a final document that includes the ``source.log`` 
test results.

To accomplish this, we provide a class hierarchy that defines the various
actions of the **py-web-lp**  application.  This class hierarchy defines an extensible set of
fundamental actions.  This gives us the flexibility to create a simple sequence
of actions and execute any combination of these.  It eliminates the need for a 
forest of ``if``-statements to determine precisely what will be done.

Each action has the potential to update the state of the overall
application.   A partner with this command hierarchy is the Application class
that defines the application options, inputs and results. 


..  _`Action class hierarchy used to describe actions of the application (53)`:
..  rubric:: Action class hierarchy used to describe actions of the application (53) =

    Used by     → `pyweb.py (79)`_.




The ``Action`` class embodies the basic operations of **py-web-lp** .
The intent of this hierarchy is to both provide an easily expanded method of
adding new actions, but an easily specified list of actions for a particular
run of **py-web-lp** .

The overall process of the application is defined by an instance of ``Action``.
This instance may be the ``WeaveAction`` instance, the ``TangleAction`` instance
or a ``ActionSequence`` instance.

The instance is constructed during parsing of the input parameters.  Then the 
``Action`` class ``perform()`` method is called to actually perform the
action.  There are three standard ``Action`` instances available: an instance
that is a macro and does both tangling and weaving, an instance that excludes tangling,
and an instance that excludes weaving.  These correspond to the command-line options.

..  parsed-literal::

    anOp = SomeAction("name")
    anOp(*argparse.Namespace*)


The ``Action`` is the superclass for all actions.
An ``Action`` has a number of common attributes.

:name:
    A name for this action.
    
:options:
    The ``argparse.Namespace`` object.
    A LoadAction will update this with the ``Web`` object that was loaded.
    
!start:
    The time at which the action started.

ActionSequence Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``ActionSequence`` defines a composite action; it is a sequence of
other actions.  When the macro is performed, it delegates to the 
sub-actions.

The instance is created during parsing of input parameters.  An instance of
this class is one of
the three standard actions available; it generally is the default, "do everything" 
action.

This class overrides the ``perform()`` method of the superclass.  It also adds
an ``append()`` method that is used to construct the sequence of actions.

WeaveAction Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``WeaveAction`` defines the action of weaving.  This action
logs a message, and invokes the ``weave()`` method of the ``Web`` instance.
This method also includes the basic decision on which weaver to use.  If a ``Weaver`` was
specified on the command line, this instance is used.  Otherwise, the first few characters
are examined and a weaver is selected.

This class overrides the ``__call__()`` method of the superclass.

If the options include ``theWeaver``, that ``Weaver`` instance will be used.
Otherwise, the ``web.language()`` method function is used to guess what weaver to use.

is never defined.

LoadAction Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``LoadAction`` defines the action of loading the web structure.  This action
uses the application's ``webReader`` to actually do the load.

An instance is created during parsing of the input parameters.  An instance of
this class is part of any of the weave, tangle and "do everything" action.

This class overrides the ``__call__()`` method of the superclass.

The options **must** include ``webReader``, with the ``WebReader`` instance to be used.

Trying to load the web involves two steps, either of which can raise 
exceptions due to incorrect inputs.

1.  The ``WebReader`` class ``load()`` method can raise exceptions for a number of 
    syntax errors as well as OS errors.

    -     Missing closing brackets (``@}``, ``@]`` or ``@>``).

    -     Missing opening bracket (``@{`` or ``@[``) after a chunk name (``@d`` or ``@o``).

    -     Extra brackets (``@{``, ``@[``, ``@}``, ``@]``).

    -     Extra ``@|``.

    -     The input file does not exist or is not readable.

2.  The ``Web`` class ``createUsedBy()`` method can raise an exception when a 
    chunk reference cannot be resolved to a named chunk.

The Application Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Application`` class is provided so that the ``Action`` instances
have an overall application to update.  This allows the ``WeaveAction`` to 
provide the selected ``Weaver`` instance to the application.  It also provides a
central location for the various options and alternatives that might be accepted from
the command line.


The constructor creates a default ``argparse.Namespace`` with values
suitable for weaving and tangling.

The ``parseArgs()`` method uses the ``sys.argv`` sequence to 
parse the command line arguments and update the options.  This allows a
program to pre-process the arguments, passing other arguments to this module.


The ``process()`` method processes a list of files.  This is either
the list of files passed as an argument, or it is the list of files
parsed by the ``parseArgs()`` method.


The ``parseArgs()`` and process() functions are separated so that
another application can ``import pyweb``, bypass command-line parsing, yet still perform
the basic actionss simply and consistently.
For example:

..  parsed-literal::

    import pyweb, argparse
    
    p = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    *argument definition*
    config = p.parse_args()
    
    a = pyweb.Application()
    *Configure the Application based on options*
    a.process(config)


The ``main()`` function creates an ``Application`` instance and
calls the ``parseArgs()`` and ``process()`` methods to provide the
expected default behavior for this module when it is used as the main program.

The configuration can be either a ``types.SimpleNamespace`` or an
``argparse.Namespace`` instance.

The first part of parsing the command line is 
setting default values that apply when parameters are omitted.
The default values are set as follows:

:defaults:
    A default configuration.

:webReader:
    is the ``WebReader`` instance created for the current
    input file.
 
:doWeave:
    instance of ``Action``
    that does weaving only.

:doTangle:
    instance of ``Action``
    that does tangling only.
    
:theAction:
    is an instance of ``Action`` that describes
    the default overall action: load, tangle and weave.  This is the default unless
    overridden by an option.
    
Here are the configuration values. These are attributes
of the ``argparse.namespace`` default as well as the updated
namespace returned by ``parseArgs()``.

:verbosity:
    Either ``logging.INFO``, ``logging.WARN`` or ``logging.DEBUG``
    
:command:
    is set to ``@`` as the  default command introducer.

:permit:
    The raw list of permitted command characters, perhaps ``'i'``.
    
:permitList:
    provides a list of commands that are permitted
    to fail.  Typically this is empty, or contains ``@i`` to allow the include
    command to fail.

:files:
    is the final list of argument files from the command line; 
    these will be processed unless overridden in the call to ``process()``.

!skip:
    a list of steps to skip: perhaps ``'w'`` or ``'t'`` to skip weaving or tangling.
    
:weaver:
    the short name of the weaver.
    
:theTangler:
    is set to a ``TanglerMake`` instance 
    to create the output files.

:theWeaver:
    is set to an instance of a subclass of ``Weaver`` based on ``weaver``

The algorithm for parsing the command line parameters uses the built in
``argparse`` module.  We have to build a parser, define the options,
and the parse the command-line arguments, updating the default namespace.

We further expand on the arguments. This transforms simple strings into object
instances.

The ``process()`` function uses the current ``Application`` settings
to process each file as follows:

1.  Create a new ``WebReader`` for the ``Application``, providing
    the parameters required to process the input file.

2.  Create a ``Web`` instance, *w* 
    and set the Web's *sourceFileName* from the WebReader's *filePath*.

3.  Perform the given command, typically a ``ActionSequence``, 
    which does some combination of load, tangle the output files and
    weave the final document in the target language; if
    necessary, examine the ``Web`` to determine the documentation language.

4.  Print a performance summary line that shows lines processed per second.

In the event of failure in any of the major processing steps, 
a summary message is produced, to clarify the state of 
the output files, and the exception is reraised.
The re-raising is done so that all exceptions are handled by the 
outermost main program.

This has two configuration approaches. If a positional argument is given,
that dictionary is used for ``logging.config.dictConfig``. Otherwise,
keyword arguments are provided to ``logging.basicConfig``.

We can load this with something like the following:

        config = toml.load(config_file)
    log_config = config.get('logging', {'version': 1, level=logging.INFO})

This makes it slightly easier to add and change debuging alternatives.
Rather then use the ``-v`` and ``-d`` options, the ``pyweb.toml`` 
provides a complete logging config. 

Also, we might want a decorator to define loggers more consistently for each class definition.

The Main Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The top-level interface is the ``main()`` function.
This function creates an ``Application`` instance.

The ``Application`` object parses the command-line arguments.
Then the ``Application`` object does the requested processing.
This two-step process allows for some dependency injection to customize argument processing.

We might also want to parse a logging configuration file, as well
as a weaver template configuration file.

The `Overheads`_ are described below, they include things like:

-     shell escape

-     doc string

-     ``__version__`` setting


`Python Library Imports`_ are actually scattered in various places in this description.


The more important elements are described in separate sections:

Python Library Imports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Numerous Python library modules are used by this application. 

A few are listed here because they're used widely. Others are listed
closer to where they're referenced.

-   The ``os`` module provide os-specific file and path manipulations; it is used
    to transform the input file name into the output file name as well as track down file modification
    times.

-   The ``time`` module provides a handy current-time string; this is used
    to by the HTML Weaver to write a closing timestamp on generated HTML files, 
    as well as log messages.
    
-   The ``datetime`` module is used to format times, phasing out use of ``time``.

-   The ``types`` module is used to get at ``SimpleNamespace`` for configuration.

Overheads
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shell escape is provided so that the user can define this
file as executable, and launch it directly from their shell.
The shell reads the first line of a file; when it finds the ``'#!'`` shell
escape, the remainder of the line is taken as the path to the binary program
that should be run.  The shell runs this binary, providing the 
file as standard input.

A Python ``__doc__`` string provides a standard vehicle for documenting
the module or the application program.  The usual style is to provide
a one-sentence summary on the first line.  This is followed by more 
detailed usage information.

The keyword cruft is a standard way of placing version control information into
a Python module so it is preserved.  See PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) #8 for information
on recommended styles.


We also sneak in a "DO NOT EDIT" warning that belongs in all generated application 
source files.

This can be extended by doing something like the following.

1.  Subclass ``Weaver`` create a subclass with different templates.

2.  Update the ``pyweb.weavers`` dictionary.

3.  Call ``pyweb.main()`` to run the existing
    main program with extra classes available to it.


..  parsed-literal::

    import pyweb
    class MyWeaver(HTML):
       *Any template changes*
     
    pyweb.weavers['myweaver']= MyWeaver()
    pyweb.main()


This will create a variant on **py-web-lp** that will handle a different
weaver via the command-line option ``-w myweaver``.


..  py-web-tool/src/test.w

Unit Tests
===========

The ``tests`` directory includes ``pyweb_test.w``, which will create a 
complete test suite.

This source will weaves a ``pyweb_test.html`` file. See `tests/pyweb_test.html <tests/pyweb_test.html>`_.

This source will tangle several test modules:  ``test.py``, ``test_tangler.py``, ``test_weaver.py``,
``test_loader.py``, ``test_unit.py``, and ``test_scripts.py``.  

Use **pytest** to discover and run all 80+ test cases.

Here's a script that works out well for running this without disturbing the development
environment. The ``PYTHONPATH`` setting is essential to support importing ``pyweb``.

..	parsed-literal::

	python pyweb.py -o tests tests/pyweb_test.w
	PYTHONPATH=$(PWD) pytest

Note that the last line really does set an environment variable and run 
the ``pytest`` tool on a single line.

Handy Scripts and Other Files
=================================================

Two aditional scripts, ``tangle.py`` and ``weave.py``, are provided as examples 
which can be customized and extended.

``tangle.py`` Script
---------------------

This script shows a simple version of Tangling.  This has a permitted 
error for '@i' commands to allow an include file (for example test results)
to be omitted from the tangle operation.

Note the general flow of this top-level script.

1.	Create the logging context.

2.	Create the options. This hard-coded object is a stand-in for 
	parsing command-line options. 
	
3.	Create the web object.

4.	For each action (``LoadAction`` and ``TangleAction`` in this example)
	Set the web, set the options, execute the callable action, and write
	a summary.

``weave.py`` Script
---------------------

This script shows a simple version of Weaving.  This shows how
to define a customized set of templates for a different markup language.


A customized weaver generally has three parts.

To override templates, a class
needs to provide a text definition of
the Jinja ``{% macro %}`` definitions.
This is used to update the superclass
``template_map``.

Something like the following sets the macros in use.

    self.template_map['html_macros'] = my_templates

Any macro **not** defined gets a default implementation.

..    py-web-tool/src/todo.w 

 
To Do
======= 
   
1.  Change the comment start and comment end options
    to use Jinja template fragments.
    There needs to be an ``-add '# {{chunk.position}}'``
    which overrides the default of ``''`` and injects
    this into each Tangled chunk. Indented appropriately.
    
1.  Implement all four alternative references in the ``end_code()`` macro.

    -   Nothing. 

    -   The immediate reference. 

    -   The two variants on full paths: 

        -   top-down ``→ Named (1) / → Sub-Named (2) / → Sub-Sub-Named (3)``

        -   bottom-up ``→ Sub-Sub-Named (3) ∈ → Sub-Named (2) ∈ → Named (1)``

#.  Implement ``@h`` command and ``HiddenOutputChunk``. This may be sufficient.
    Tangling can then include non-woven output files. 
    Viewed the other way, Weaving can exclude the non-woven file.
    The use case is a book chapter with test cases that are **not** woven into the text.
    See https://github.com/slott56/py-web-tool/wiki/Tangle-only-Output.
       
#.  Permit selecting a specific ``begin_code()`` template for a named block. 
    A book may have distinct formatting for REPL examples and code examples.
    It may be as small as CSS classes for RST or HTML. It may be a more elaborate
    set of differences in LaTeX.

#.  Update the ``-indent`` option on ``@d`` chunks to accept a numeric argument with the 
    specific indentation value. This becomes a kind of "noindent" with a given
    value. The ``-noindent`` would then be the same as ``-indent 0``.  
    Currently, `-indent` and `-noindent` are true/false flags. 
    
#.  We might want to decompose the ``impl.w`` file: it's huge.
    The four major sections -- base model, output, input parsing, other components -- make sense.
    However, since the output is a *single* .rst file, it doesn't change much to do this.

#.  We might want to interleave code and test into a document that presents both
    side-by-side. We can route the tangled code to multiple files.
    It can be awkward to create tangled files in multiple directories, however.
    We'd have to use ``../tests/whatever.py``, **assuming** we were always using ``-o src``.

#.  Rename the module from ``pyweb`` to ``pylpweb`` to avoid name squatting issues.
    Rename the project from ``py-web-lp`` to ``py-lpweb``.
    
#.  Offer a basic XHTML template that uses ``CDATA`` sections instead of quoting.
    Does require the standard quoting for the ``CDATA`` end tag.
    
#.  Note that the overall ``Web`` is a bit like a ``NamedChunk`` that contains ``Chunks``.
    This similarity could be factored out. 
    While this will create a more proper **Composition** pattern implementation, it
    leads to the question of why nest ``@d`` or ``@o`` chunks in the first place?


..    py-web-tool/src/done.w

Change Log
===========


Changes for 3.2

-   Rename to ``py-web-lp`` to limit collisions in PyPI.

-   Replaced ``toml`` with ``tomli`` or built-in ``tomllib``.

-   Fiddle with ``pyproject.toml`` and ``tox.ini`` to eliminate ``setup.py``.

-   Replaced home-brewed ``OptionParser`` with ``argparse.ArgumentParser``.
    Now the options for ``@d`` and ``@o`` can be *much* more flexible.

-   Added the transitive path of references as a Chunk property.
    Removes ``SimpleReference`` and ``TransitiveReference`` classes,
    and the associated "reference_style" attribute of a ``Weaver``.
    To show transitive references, a revised ``code_end`` template is required.

-   Added a TOML-based configuration file with a ``[logging]`` section. 

-   Incorporated Sphinx and PlantUML into the documentation.
    Support continues for ```rst2html.py``. It's used for test documentaion. 
    See https://github.com/slott56/py-web-tool/wiki/PlantUML-support-for-RST-%5BCompleted%5D

-   Replaced weaving process with Jinja templates. 
    See https://github.com/slott56/py-web-tool/wiki/Jinja-Template-for-Weaving-%5BCompleted%5D

-   Dramatic redesign to Class, Chunk, and Command class hierarchies.

-   Dramatic redesign to Emitters to switch to using Jinja templates.
    By stepping away from the ``string.Template``,
    we can incorporate list-processing ``{% for %}...{% endfor %}`` construct that 
    pushes some processing into the template.

-   Removed ``'\N{LOZENGE}'`` (borrowed from Interscript) and use the ``'\N{END OF PROOF}'`` symbol instead.

-   Created a better ``weave.py`` example that shows how to incorporate bootstrap CSS into HTML overrides.
    This also requires designing a more easily extended ``Weaver`` class.
    
Changes for 3.1

-   Change to Python 3.10 as the supported version.

-   Add type hints, f-strings, ``pathlib``, ``abc.ABC``.

-   Replace some complex ``elif`` blocks with ``match`` statements.

-   Use **pytest** as a test runner.

-   Add a ``Makefile``, ``pyproject.toml``, ``requirements.txt`` and ``requirements-dev.txt``.

-   Implement ``-o dir`` option to write output to a directory of choice, simplifying **tox** setup.

-   Add ``bootstrap`` directory with a snapshot of a previous working release to simplify development.

-   Add Test cases for ``weave.py`` and ``tangle.py``

-   Replace hand-build mock classes with ``unittest.mock.Mock`` objects

-   Separate the projec into ``src``, ``tests``, ``examples``. Cleanup ``Makefile``, ``pyproject.toml``, etc.

-   Silence the ERROR-level logging during testing.

-   Clean up the examples

Changes for 3.0

-   Move to GitHub

Changes for 2.3.2.

-   Fix all ``{:s}`` format strings to be ``{!s}``.

Changes for 2.3.1.

-   Cleanup some stray comment errors.

-   Revise the documentation structure and organization.

-   Tweak the error messages.

Changes for 2.3.

-   Changed to Python 3.3 -- Fixed ``except``, ``raise`` and ``%``.

-   Removed ``doWrite()`` and simplified ``doOpen()`` and ``doClose()``.

-   Cleaned up RST output to be much nicer.

-   Change the baseline ``pyweb.w`` file to be RST instead of HTML.
    docutils required to produce HTML from the woven output.

-   Removed the unconstrained ``eval()`` function. Provided a slim set of globals.
    ``os`` is really just ``os.path``.
    Any ``os.getcwd()`` can be changed to ``os.path.realpath('.')``.
    ``time`` was removed and replaced with ``datetime``.
    Any ``time.asctime()`` must be ``datetime.datetime.now().ctime()``.

-   Resolved a small dispute between ``weaveReferenceTo()`` (wrong) and ``tangle()`` (right).
    for NamedChunks. The issue was one of failure to understand the differences
    between weaving -- where indentation is localized -- and tangling -- where indentation
    must be tracked globally. Root cause was a huge problem in ``codeBlock()`` which didn't
    really weave properly at all. 

-   Fix the tokenizer and parsing. Stop using a complex tokenizer and use a simpler
    iterator over the tokens with ``StopIteration`` exception handling.
    
-   Replace ``optparse`` with ``argparse``. 

-   Get rid of the global ``logger`` variable.

-   Remove the filename as part of ``Web()`` initial creation. 
    A basename comes from the initial ``.w`` file loaded by the ``WebReader``. 

-   Fix the Action class hierarchy so that composite actions are simpler. 

-   Change references to return ``Chunk`` objects, not ``(name,sequence)`` pairs.

-   Make the ref list separator in ``Weaver reference summary...`` a proper template
    feature, not a hidden punctuation mark in the code.
    
-   Configure ``Web.reference_style`` properly so that simple or transitive references
    can be included as a command-line option. The default is Simple.
    Add the ``-r`` option so that ``-rt`` includes transitive references.
    
-   Reduce the "hard-coded" punctuation. For example, the ``", "`` in 
    ``@d Web weave...`` ``weaveChunk()``.  This was moved into a template.

-   Add an ``__enter__()`` and ``__exit__()`` to make an ``Emitter``
    into a proper Context Manager that can be used with a ``with`` statement.
    
-   Add the ``-n`` option to include tangler line numbers if the ``@o`` includes
    the comment characters.

-   Cleanup the ``TanglerMake`` unit tests to remove the ``sleep()`` 
    used to assure that the timestamps really are different.
    
-   Cleanup the syntax for adding a comment template to ``@o``. Use ``-start`` and ``-end``
    before the filename.
    
-   Cleanup the syntax for noindent named chunks. Use ``-noindent`` before the chunk name.
    This creates a distinct ``NamedChunk_Noindent`` instance that handles indentation
    differently from other ``Chunk`` subclasses.
    
-   Cleanup the ``TangleAction`` summary.

-   Clean up the error messages. Raising an exception seems
    heavy-handed and confusing.  Count errors instead. 


Changes since version 1.4

-   Removed home-brewed logger.

-   Replaced ``getopt`` with ``optparse``.

-   Replaced LaTeX markup.

-   Corrected significant problems in cross-reference resolution.

-   Replaced all HTML and LaTeX-specific features with a much simpler template
    engine which applies a template to a Chunk.  The Templates are separate
    configuration items.  The big issue with templates are conditional processing
    and the use of loops to handle multiple references in a transitive closure.
    While it's nice to depend on Jinja2, it's also nice to be totally stand-alone.
    Sigh.  Choices include the no-logic ``string.Template`` in the standard library
    or the ``Templite+`` Recipe 576663.

-   Looked at SCons API.  Renamed "Operation" to "Action"; renamed "perform" to "__call__".  
    Consider having "__call__" which does logging, then call "execute".  

-   Eliminated the EmitterFactory; replace this with simple injection of
    the proper template configuration.  

-   Removed the ``@O`` command; it was essentially a variant template for LaTeX.

-   Disentangled indentation and quoting in the codeBlock.
    Indentation rules vary between Tangling and Weaving.
    Quoting is unique to a woven codeBlock.  Fix ``referenceTo()``  to write
    indented without code quoting.

-   Offer a basic RST template.
    Note that colorizing may be easier to handle with an RST template.
    The weaving markup template degenerates 
    to ``..   parsed-literal::`` and indent.  By doing this,
    the RST output from *pyWeb* can be run through DocUtils ``rst2html.py``
    or perhaps *Sphix* to create final HTML. The hard part is the indent.

-   Tweaked (but didn't fix) ReferenceCommand tangle and all setIndent/clrIndent operations. 
    Only a ReferenceCommand actually cares about indentation.  And that indentation
    is totally based on the "context" plus the text in the Command immediate in front
    of the ReferenceCommand.
